DeepSeek-1.5B,"[ WP ] You 've finally managed to discover the secret to immortality . Suddenly , Death appears before you , hands you a business card , and says , `` When you realize living forever sucks , call this number , I 've got a job offer for you . ''
","So many times have I walked on ruins, the remainings of places that I loved and got used to.. At first I was scared, each time I could feel my city, my current generation collapse, break into the black hole that thrives within it, I could feel humanity, the way I'm able to feel my body.. After a few hundred years, the pattern became obvious, no longer the war and damage that would devastate me over and over again in the far past was effecting me so dominantly. 
 It's funny, but I felt as if after gaining what I desired so long, what I have lived for my entire life, only then, when I achieved immortality I started truly aging. 
 
 5 world wars have passed, and now they feel like a simple sickeness that would pass by every so often, I could no longer evaluate the individual human as a being of its own, the importance of mortals is merely the same as the importance of my skin cells; They are a part of a mechanism so much more advanced, a mechanism that is so dear to my fallen heart a mechanism that I have seen fall and rise so many times, a mechanism that when lost all of which it had, had me loosing my will to live, for the first time in all of my thousands years of existence. 
 
 Acceptance, something so important. a skill that has proved itself worthy dozens of times, an ability that looks so easy to achieve, a gift, that I was n't able to aquire in all my years, until now. When the ashes on the ground flew into the now empty air upon humanity's fall, I felt as if all of it's weight was crushing me. Ignorance took over and I searched years for a hope, a sign of the very same patterns that I used to watch reappear every hundred years, the very core of my will to exist that was now no more that I so strongly wish was. 
 
 If you have ever wondered if silence can drive people crazy, it can.. 
 I ca n't feel my legs, I have walked for days, just to hear the sound of gravel, crushed bones, crushed buildings and crushed civilizations under my steps to keep my sanity.. until I remembered, the day in my far past. The day of my rebirth, I took out of my pocket a small plastic box, with nine buttons and a small glass window. I could n't believe this was our past, I could n't believe how far we have been able to progress and yet, be destroyed by our own violence. 
 I slowly dialed the number I was given, exactly 1729 years ago. 
 
 I dropped a tear, a tear that was too slow to hit the ground as I got sucked into the darkness that emerged around me. 
 
 A chill went through my spine as I saw my destiny rise above me, I could see the white teeth under the dark cloack... 
 
 `` You have finally arrived'' He projected into my mind, with the most chilling cold and unhuman voice. 
 
 `` I'm ready to obey'' I answered. I knew who was sitting infront of me, and it was time for me to obey him, after all these years of playing god, even I came to it. 
 
 Funny is n't it? Even by achieving immortality, death, is inescapable.

","-Week 18 aboard the Depth Reaver, Circa 2023- 
 
 I walk about the dull gray halls, the artificial gravity making my steps feel almost as if they were on land. Almost. I glance out a window as I pass it by. There's the sun, and there's the moon right there. And, of course, there's the Earth. I kinda miss it. Then again, space is pretty cool. It's got some brilliant views, and the wifi is surprisingly good. Even countless miles away from the Earth, I can crush Silver noobs on CS GO. 
 
 I pass by Dale Malkowitz, the head scientist on board. 
 
 `` Evening, Dale,'' I say. 
 
 `` What up, Danny?'' he replies cordially. 
 
 `` Nothin' much. A little bored, I guess.'' 
 
 He shakes his head in disbelief. `` I really, *really* do n't understand how you can be bored in space.'' 
 
 `` Well hey,'' I say slightly defensively, `` Aside from the views, it's kinda... dull. And empty. And stuff.'' 
 
 `` Whatever you say, Wittell,'' he says, not unkindly. Then he walks off. A few moments pass, and then I decide to look out the window right by me. As my eyes scan the inky blackness of space ( again ), I notice something odd about the moon's surface. It's slightly... cracked. 
 
 `` Hey, Malkowitz?'' I call out, `` You might wan na check this out!'' 
 
 He walks over to me casually, probably expecting nothing. `` What?'' he asks, `` What do you see?'' 
 
 I point at the moon. His brow furrows. `` Huh... I guess there's something up with the surface. I'll have to look into tha-'' 
 
 Suddenly, the surface cracks a little more. We glance at each other, and then back at the moon, and then at each other again, and then back at the moon again. 
 
 `` What's going on?'' I ask, alarmed. 
 
 He's silent for a minute or two, mouth hanging open. Then, he calls out: `` Janice! Terry! Johnny! Get over here! Something's up with the moon.'' 
 
 The other crewmates enter, unsure of what to expect. As their eyes lay upon the moon's surface cracks, they widen. 
 
 And, by coincidence, more cracks appear at that very moment. And then more. And more. And more. And more... 
 
 Little bits of the moon begin to float away, torn free of the rest of the surface. We all stare, speechless. And then... it happens. It *happens*. 
 
 The side of the moon facing us is... torn away by a... 
 
 Human... hand? 
 
 And we see... 
 
 A giant... human face?! 
 
 Surprisingly, I can hear my thoughts over my racing heart. *I ca n't help but feel as if I recognize that face... from the... * 
 
 *Internet. * 
 
 Suddenly, the great face's lips move. 
 
 Of course, none of us can actually *hear* it speak, because of the laws of space and whatnot. However, I can read its lips, and it appears to be saying: 
 
 `` Are you sure about that?''

","I was feckin' sloshed, mate. First time I ever was in the Big Lemon, and I'd found me the best feckin' pub I could imagine, I tell ya what. So I stumble out when it was closin' time, musta been'round 4 o'clock in the morning, and made my way through some alleys to find the quaint little AirBnB place I'd rented for the week. 
 
 A'course, that's how many a horror story starts, ainnit? But it was all fun and games at first. There was this bloke I saw comin' towards me in the alley, dark as it was with only a few lights from some apartments overhead, where the folk were still awake. At least, I thought it was a bloke, but he looked more like there was n't something right with the whole alleyway. Like it was a painting someone had gone and ripped with a knife for some reason, fecked-up as it all looked, and the cut looked sort of weird and silvery, and wavy like a heat haze comin' from a welder's torch. 
 
 Now this thing must've been a good foot or five taller'n me, but sloshed as I am, I just take off my hat and give it a good `` how-do-you-do'','cause I'm a nice fellow and I wan na pass, y'see? Now this thing up and goes give me a `` mighty fine, how about y'self, sir!'' I feckin' quite pissed my britches! More in surprise'n anythin', really, but I keep my composure and just sorta try and pass'm as he walks past me with his long, spindly legs as silvery as the rest of'm, with his feet makin' noises like he's wearin' cowboy boots with those thingies on'm. But then that moment stupid old me finds I forgot my lighter at the pub, and so I turn and ask spindleboots there if he's got some fire for me. 
 
 Darn buggerer turns around on the spot faster'n my eyes can see and says, he says `` sure! I got your fire here.'' And the feckin' thing stretches out one of his spindly legs and wraps it around me like a cobra and pulls me into itself. Devil's pits, that felt like I was bein' burnt layer of skin by layer. He sure got me with that. Good feckin' joke, mate. 
 
 Must've been out like a light for ages, but when I woke up, I find myself here. So tell me, Doc: are time travellers really that sought after as subjects of study?'Cause I know you found me in your fancy cyberwebs database thing and I ca n't be three hundred years old as my passport would say if I had one, but I'd really like to not die, y'know? What do y'say, wan na go and grab a beer at the pub?
","You can choose to go ahead or skip ahead in this walking.
Your goal is to find the maximum possible time you can
reach the target.
But, you can't skip ahead unless you have
either
the ability to generate the time or
the ability to stop the time.
So, you can generate the time by walking through
the alleys one by one, but you can't stop the time once you've
generated it. Or can you?

As my eyes closed the only thing I saw was the time on the TV screen in front of me, faded blue numbers that read 10:34AM. 
 
 Unless your plane explodes. Searing heat tears through flesh and shard of metal pierce every nerve, for a fraction of a fraction of a moment there is nothing but horrendous pain and then there is darkness. 
 
 That's when I woke up, drenched in sweat, eyes wide with fear and panic. The first thing I noticed was the time. 
 
 9:35AM 
 
 It had been so real. It was real. That was no dream, it could n't have been... 
 
 I glance around to my fellow passengers and wonder how it happened. What caused it? Can we stop it? Stop the plane, I want to get off? 
 
 I've been a cop for a long time, that's the good news. 
 
 The bad? 
 
 I'm stuck in a metal tube that I think is going to explode in less than an hour and I have to find out how without panicking anyone. 
 
 Especially if I'm wrong.

 That's really bad. Not like anyone would believe me. 
 
 I'm not entirely sure I believe me. 
 
 My only hope is that I can find out what causes the whole thing before the whole thing happens. 
 
 Terrorism? I mean, I guess it could be but that's a slim shot in the dark. 
 
 So what in the blue hell blows up a plane over the ocean? 
 
 First stop? Bathroom. Experience an explosion is enough to make you feel the urge to... relieve yourself.

 I wave to her and motion towards the washrooms. 
 
 `` You saw it?'' 
 
 She nodded. 
 
 `` Did you see anything?'' 
 
 She shook her head. 
 
 This was n't productive. There had to be something, some piece of information that either of us had buried in our brains that would be useful. Then something clicked. 
 
 `` Do you remember which way the explosion came from?'' 
 
 She tilted her head as if she was remembering. 
 
 `` Yeah, the heat was in front of me. What the hell is going on?'' 
 
 I looked back to the passengers. There were six rows between her seat and mine. Six rows of nine, that's... 54 if any math from school stuck. 
 
 `` Hey, did you hear me?'' She said, grabbing my arm. 
 
 `` Yeah! It came from in front of you. It came from behind me. So that means-'' 
 
 `` It started somewhere between us.'' She finished, which would usually annoy me but in this case it was nice to have someone pick up on it nice and quick. 
 
 I checked my watch. 
 
 9:41AM. 
 
 We were running out of time.

 `` Does anyone stick out to you?'' she whispered and I shook my head. We could probably eliminate a few potential suspects by process of elimination. A young family probably was n't going to cause a problem, the elderly couple as well. Stuff like that. 
 
 As I watched I saw there were three people acting nervously. 
 
 One portly man checking his watch a little too frequently. 
 
 A younger man sweating profusely. 
 
 A woman glancing around with what I would describe as suspicion. 
 
 I pointed them out to her and she agreed. So maybe we had three suspects. Or maybe we had three nervous flyers. 
 
 9:45AM. 
 
 Seconds were ticking by and we had a very limited number of those to start. 
 
 As we stood there a flight attendant approached us from behind. 
 
 She startled both of us and that's when the woman turned and locked eyes with me. Then her eyes went wide and she knew that someone knew. She bolted from her seat and reached for the overhead compartment. That's when I slammed into her full force, throwing both our bodies to the hard floor and skidding at least three rows ahead. 
 
 When I lifted my head I was staring down the barrel of a handgun. 
 
 A young man, sweating profusely, was holding the right end of it and I was definitely on the wrong end. 
 
 He was n't holding a badge though. Which meant things were going from bad to worse.

","The mountain stood still and large beneath the Warrior. It had not trembled in the days since the people chose him as their Champion. `` Perhaps the Dragon slumbers yet,'' he thought. `` I shall wake him, soon enough.'' He strode forward, heavily, in his iron raiment, shining dully in the morning sun. The shrouded peak drew slowly nearer as the sun climbed the sky, mirroring the Warrior's toil this day as the last. The Dragon slept silently in its lair amidst the clouds. 
 
 For generations the people had not seen it wake. But their stories, told by night and hearth fire, still remained hushed in reverence of its deadly wrath. Legends told of it waking and the destruction that followed. But that was before. Before the people had tamed iron and bent it to their will. Now they had weapons that could fight the myth. That could quench the fire. 
 
 The Warrior stopped at the edge of the cloud bank, just as the sun had stopped there hours before. He breathed. Deliberately he pulled the heavy iron axe from his belt and gripped it between strong hands. A glow had appeared within the clouds. The mountain rumbled. 
 
 `` I have come to wake you, beast, and I have come to show you the people no longer fear you.'' The ground rolled and thundered. He roared in defiance and raised his axe, charging into the fog. He half ran and climbed in muffled beats as his bloodlust for the Dragon pounded in his ears. The glow grew brighter and the ground shook violently. 
 
 A gout of flame split the clouds in front of the Warrior and he saw his destination. The rock ended in a ridge just above him and the Dragons flames beat and splashed beyond. Without breaking stride, the iron Warrior crested the ridge and leapt, axe raised high, into a pit of Dragon fire.

","I open my eyes in a panic, sweat beading and then falling down my face. I look around and the sun in shining through the maroon curtains of my studio apartment. Everything seems to be as I left it the afternoon before, but there is a heavy, unfamiliar air in the room. I notice the throw cover I lazily hang to separate my twin size bed from the rest of the apartment has been ripped to the ground, and that the kitchen faucet rhythmically drips against the cold steel sink. I was alone last night like I always am, I think. No one has been here but me in over three months. 
 
 I'm not allowed to think about it much longer, as the feeling in my stomach bubbles over and pops once more as it had been doing all night, slowly worsening. I pinch my eyes shut, knowing what's coming next, and for just one moment, as the pain peaks like a giant wave waiting to break, I think I may just die this time. And just as quickly, the wave reaches the shore, and I know I have a few moments of peace. I open my eyes and look around. I ca n't help but surrender to the weight of them after a few moments, and I drift to an uneasy sleep, as the tension escapes from my stomach and from the rest of my body, dissipating into the small space I call home. 
 
 The next wave takes what remains in me and decimates it. The pain blinds me, numbing me to all feeling and sensation. The relief never comes as I close my eyes involuntarily. 
 
 I finally come to and realize I had been asleep for a while. I open my eyes and, fighting the blinding lights and white room, I see that the natural maroon lighting of my apartment has been replaced by white hospital lights. Beyond the thick glass walls of the room that was smaller than my apartment - though I did n't think it got smaller than that - stand people I have never seen before, looking at papers and analyzing the rhythms of the machines I now realize I am hooked up to. The men all stop and slowly turn their unexpected gazes at me as I begin to curl my sore body into a seated position, only to be shocked back down by a face that made the sea of unfamiliar faces fade away. 
 
 The prominent cheekbones that made my mother seem so much prouder than her nature would actually allow remained strong, though the rest of her seemed to be worn down by the years. The same mahogany curls fell across those cheeks and down right above her shoulders, though they seemed more ashen now. Her frail yet determined hand touching the impenetrable glass and reaching to pick me up and hold me, and I recall the day in my childhood where, in my insistence to become a world champion roller bladder, I fell and scrapped my knee. And I recall the comforted feeling of being cradled in her arms in fetal position. And I recall never wanting to leave the warmth of the embrace. 
 
 And just as I begin to reach out, I crouch and close my eyes to the familiar feeling that boils over in my stomach. Falling in and out of consciousness, I see quick flashes. I see my mother's crystal blue eyes well with tears that could not be held. I see her strong posture and I see the unfamiliar men gather, bowing and shaking their heads, unsure. I see the green lines of the machines jump and dance. And I see a sign, sloppily and quickly written above my bed, the only writing visible to me in my haze. It read `` Patient Zero''.

 `` Keep it together, Cindy. I need you to keep it together'' Whitney's voice is stern but supportive. 
 
 Though she does n't speak, Cindy's breathing begins to steady. 
 
 I know they are heading to the car even before I hear the doors open. In the next few seconds, they will drive off, and I can go back to being alone. 
 
 *Except their car wo n't start. You saw to that. * 
 
 The engine begins to hang, and I hear the girls swearing. They keep trying, but it's no use. 
 
 He makes me stand up and grab my machete even though I do n't want to. He makes me run despite the pain in my side. The girls scream as soon as I round the corner. They throw open their car doors and begin to flee. He tries to make me chase them, but I refuse. 
 
 *If you ca n't do what needs doing, fine. I'll do it! * 
 
 I am too weak to fight him. He takes control of me, one limb at a time, and everything fades. 
 
 When I wake up, I am in the woods. It is almost pitch black, but I can make out a tiny cabin in the distance. I start walking toward it, but my foot catches on something, almost knocking me over. I look down to see a limp figure curled into a ball beneath me. She has blonde hair and a blue dress patterned with diamonds. Some of the diamonds are red now. I try not to think about her again as I continue walking. 
 
 As I approach the cabin door, something triggers in the back of my mind. I feel isolated, safe. The door creaks as I push it open and walk inside. 
 
 There are pictures covering the walls, drawings of spaceships and planets and stars. I look closer and find that each picture has something in common: a drawing of a boy with a space helmet. He looks happy. I find something else, too: a photograph. 
 
 This one is of also of a boy, a real one. He is sitting in a wagon with a cardboard box on his head, cut up to look like the same space helmet in the drawings. He is n't alone, though; there is a man standing behind him. His face has been drawn over in a furious series of pen marks. Though I ca n't see his face, the man terrifies me. He fills me with the same kind of dread I feel every time I hear -- 
 
 A scream comes from behind me, followed by another blow to the head. I stumble around to see Whitney, this time holding a metal baseball bat. She swings at me again, but I catch it in my left hand. Before I can stop it, my right arm shoots forward and strikes her across the face. She flies backward onto an old table, which breaks underneath her. 
 
 *She's on the ground. It's time to finish it. * 
 
 I do n't want to. 
 
 *I do n't care what you want, just do what I tell you. * 
 
 No. 
 
 *Do it, you piece of shit. Do it or I will! * 
 
 NO! 
 
 I throw my machete toward the ground as his shouts fill the room. The force of it brings me to my knees. Even as I resist, I begin to feel him taking control. My right hand stiffens and begins making its way toward the weapon. Before he can grab it, I kick it away. It skids to a halt right next to Whitney. She picks it up without hesitation and lunges forward. 
 
 It surprises me that I do n't feel pain when the blade enters my chest. Then a scream pierces through my skull and I know it has hurt him instead. I feel my body begin to go limp again, though nothing steps in to take control. 
 
 `` Die!'' Whitney shouts at me, but I do n't blame her. 
 
 I do n't mind that she does n't understand. I do n't even care if he does. It's only important that I know it, that I feel it in my bones even as my vision starts to fade. 
 
 I'm not the bad guy.

DeepSeek-1.5B,"[ WP ] An alien invasion happens during an alien invasion .
","For years we had been warned. 
 Since the 40's a sparse few had seen the pattern and tried to warn us. 
 Nutjobs we called them, conspiracy theorists. 
 
 It was supposed to be a day of celebration, the republicans and democrats had been swept away in the election by the newly formed'unionists'. 
 It was at the Swearing-In Ceremony that they chose to strike. 
 
 Close to a million were gathered to witness the ceremony, when our newly elected president'Dave Johnson' ripped his facial mask of and revealed his true, reptilian face. 
 `` Sstupid little monkeyss. We have played you from the sshadowss for decadess. Now, it iss time for uss to take our rightfull place ass your overlordss!'' 
 Scream of joy quickly turned to screams of terror as reptilians revealed themselfs everywhere you looked. 
 Every guard and secret service member present had thrown off their masks and were holding their guns towards the crowd. 
 `` Do NOT ressisst uss! We have ruled you pathetic ssociety for yearss! we have replaced every leader! We have-..'' the sentence was cut short by an ear deafening boom. 
 
 `` Anthony, what iss that?! what iss going on?!!'' 
 Dave could only hiss at fellow reptilians as a large alien ship was currently hovering far above them and was sending waves of what appeared to be odd looking silver chariots towards the gathered crowd. 
 The reptiles, not knowing what to, simply watched along with the crowd as a giant holoscreen appread in the sky. 
 
 The creature that appeared tall, sleek and had grey, almost silverish skin. 
'Organics of Joo'el. We must utilies your planet to halt the Grox advance. This process involves destroying your planet, thus killing you, sorry.' 
 `` You have got to be sshitting me!, I've only been their ruler for 5 minutess and thiss sshit happenss!!'' 
 
'Defecation is irrelevant, local warlord.' 
 
 `` That'ss not what it meanss!!'' 
 Daves scales had gone from green to red during the announcement and it was only getting worse as he continued to yell at the image in the sky. 
 
 `` We sstayed hidden for yearss for thiss to happen! We wo n't let you take thiss planet when we are on the brink of victory! You silver spoon!!'' 
 
'Consent is irrelevant, local warlord. Gobal distribution achived, commencing planetary modifications, please remain calm.' 
 
 The silver chariots, seemingly ignoring Earths inhabitants, began to spread out and cut into the ground with lightbeams. 
 Seconds later, an earthquake hit, and something surfaced with it. 
 Most chariots managed to dodge in time, but those that did n't were smashed by giant constructs emerging from the earth. 
 The golems were covered in lines emitting the same yellow light that came from their eyes. 
 At their full height, they were at least 30 storys tall. 
 Every chariot retreated to a safer distance. 
 
 `` The fuck iss thiss?!!'' 
 
'Reproduction is irrelevant, local warlord.' 
 
 `` SSHUT UP SSILVER TURD!!!'' 
 
 A bellowing voice shook the ground. Forcing those on the ground to cover their ears. 
 
 { We have lain dormant for aeons. We have waited, we have awoken. } 
 
'We must utilise this planet to-' 
 
 `` WE KNOW!!!'' 
 
 { We have waited for- } 
 
 `` I DO N'T CARE!!!'' 
 
 Dave had actually managed to outshout the booming voice from the ground. More than that, anyone near him could see steam rising from his glowing red scales. 
 
 `` We have worked for thiss moument for generationss! I will not let it be ruined by ssilverware, or dirtpiles, or anything elsse!!'' 
 
 Just as Dave had finished, a rift in space above him opened, allowing a small spaceship to pass through before closing. 
 The spaceship, no bigger than a small car, was hovering 20 feet above Daves scalely head. 
 
 { Oh oh } 
 
'Oh no, an Arbiter has arrived.' 
 
 `` The fuck iss an Arbiter?!'' 
 
'Reproduction is still irrelevant.' 
 
 `` SSHUT UP!!!''

This is also my first WP post, but constructive feedback is welcome. Also, just for fun I tried to do an unofficial screenplay format, hence the weird capitalization. 
 
 -- - 
 
 Fade in to a mound of swords, tips facing us. We hear footsteps on stone, slowly getting closer. Meanwhile, the camera zooms out until we recognize this as The Iron Throne. Camera sweeps around the throne, until we are in front of middle-aged DAENARYS sitting on the throne, face blank. 
 
 After several seconds, in addition to the footsteps we now also hear the jangle of a maester's chain. Both sounds then stop, and we hear an aged but familiar voice, `` Your Grace...'' 
 
 The camera turns to face SAM, in full maester garb. We see him approaching the camera for a few seconds, and then switches to a side view as he stops at the base of the stairs. DAENARYS nods and SAM climbs the first set of stairs towards the throne and stops. 
 
 Looking from behind SAM we see DAENARYS in the throne which towers above her head. To her right stands SIR JORAH, after all these years, he's still protectively looking over her. The Hand of the King's medallion hangs from his armor. 
 
 SAM: I've just received word from The Wall. It's still holding, but they do n't think it'll hold much longer. Attacks are growing in frequency and the summer heat slowly melts the ice. 
 
 DAENARYS: What do you advise, Grand Meister? Can we do anything? 
 
 SAM: Not yet, but I've heard rumors of an ancient text which tells of a weapon greater than any the world has ever known. I was reluctant to seek it out because it involves... 
 
 A look of extreme discomfort crosses his face, almost wincing as he speaks the remaining words. 
 
 SAM:... blood magic. 
 
 DAENARYS: As protector of the realm, I must do everything in my power to defend my kingdom against the army of White Walkers. You must seek the RED WOMAN at once, perhaps she knows of this text. 
 
 JORAH, disapprovingly: Khaleesi... 
 
 DAENARYS: I hope to not need it. But if the wall may be breached, we must be prepared. In the meantime, my smiths work tirelessly to make swords and attows of Dragonstone, and convoys arrive weekly at Castle Black with these weapons and reinforcements. And Jorah, you must stop calling me that. I am... 
 
 She stands, the room quiets and the theme song plays in the background, growing louder until the end of her sentence. 
 
 DAENARYS, thundering: Daenarys Stormborn of House Targaryn, Queen of The Seven Kingdoms, Grandmother of Dragons and Protector of the Realm. 
 
 Still facing her, we hear 
 
 JORAH and SAM ( in unison ): Yes, my queen. 
 
 Fade into the next scene. 
 
 -- -- 
 
 We see a green, lush, almost idyllic island at dusk. The sea is an unusually bright blue, which would be concerning if we did n't remember it as its namesake, The Sapphire Isle. This is Tarth. 
 
 The camera pans upwards until we see a small group of children playing with wooden swords on a grassy field a ways from the beach. A woman stands in front of them, a sword fighting teacher. The camera continues upwards. We see a small castle, with a balcony over the field. Two figures sit on the balcony, indistinguishable. The camera glimpses a reflection off a golden hand. 
 
 Cut to a closeup of JAMIE and BRIENNE watching the children below. They are both old, in their fifties. We can still make out JAMIE's unadulterated good looks, and BRIENNE still... not so much. But she still looks as if she could kill you on a moment's notice. They occasionally look towards each other and smile as one of the children playfully falls and over-exuberantly feigns injury. 
 
 We hear in the distance, and from JAMIE and BRIENNE's perspective we see the field and the glowing water behind. 
 
 ARYA: Alright, that's it for today. And remember, what do we say to Death? 
 
 CHILDREN ( in unison ): NOT TODAY! 
 
 The camera shifts to a closeup of ARYA and follows her movements. 
 
 ARYA: Now inside, it's getting dark. 
 
 The children drop their swords and run to the castle. ARYA sighs and collects the swords. She walks to a nearby house and throws the swords into a shed. Through the window, we see Needle, framed and mounted on her office wall. How did she end up here, doing this? She would never know.

","He sat back in the chair, looking at the monitors behind me. Four of them were mounted a foot below ceiling height, all screens showed employees working. I glimpsed out the window to see the rows of cubicles, all with short walls so that the owner of this CPA firm could watch the employees constantly. 
 
 *What a controlling bastard. * 
 
 I was here for a contract job, working only for tax season. The owner said that would give me the place of honor right outside the office window that overlooked the cube farm. *Place of honor, my ass. * 
 
 `` I've decided that the best way to verify that a potential employ will --'' he paused and steepled his fingers in font of his chin, like a smug villain in a cartoon, `` -- fit in, is to give them a personality test. Do you have time to do that?'' 
 
 I wanted to tell him where to shove it because there was no way I wanted to work for him, but instead I nodded eagerly. `` I've done those before. Sure.'' 
 
 `` This test is put out by a group that specializes in management.'' He named a certain religious group that I knew valued subservience. `` They're the ones who score it and then send me back the results. Not a lot of people pass it.'' 
 
 *Just great. * I nodded and smiled like a bobble-head. God, this was getting old. 
 
 He handed me the test, told me it was timed, and watched me like a hawk while I filled in the little bubbles. I did n't answer honestly, as he'd insisted, but instead drew from my knowledge of what the religious group valued. Test complete, he smiled smugly and told me that he'd get it scored and let my recruiter know if he wanted to proceed. 
 
 I had n't even gotten home before my recruiter called. `` I do n't believe it! I've sent him fifteen people and no one has passed the personality test! He wants to make you an offer.'' 
 
 I laughed. `` I'm going to decline, Bob.'' ( His name really is Bob. ) 
 
 Bob was shocked. `` But he wants to offer you a job.'' 
 
 I explained that I lied on the test. That I'd known he was looking for a blind follower and that was n't me. I'd just passed the exam to see if I could. 
 
 Bob fell silent, mulling over my statement. `` So, if I was going to tell someone how to pass the test, what should I tell them?'' 
 
 `` Tell them he wants blind obedience and they should taylor their answers to that. Tell them he's going to watch them constantly and probably counts the pens every night to make sure they do n't steal any.'' 
 
 `` Oh,'' Bob grunted. `` Sound like the job, if they got it, would really suck.'' 
 
 *No kiddin. * `` Find me something else Bob.'' 
 
 It's three years later and Bob told me recently that he still has never found anyone who wanted to work for the guy.

","`` Disengaging from primary module. Do you copy?'' 
 
 `` Copy, Solo 1. Confirm separation.'' 
 
 `` Separation complete.'' 
 
 `` Looks good. Ready when you are, Commander.'' 
 
 `` Roger that. Engaging thrusters.'' 
 
 Gazing upon the comet, Commander Harrison felt consumed by his awareness of its gravitational pull as he had for many months in this mission. Everything had centered around this grand celestial meeting. Now finally up close, the comet looked more lovely than he had imagined. The pull was so much stronger now, defying his most basic fears. Those deadly gaseous streams whirled off the comet's surface, in a dance both beautiful and terrifying. 
 
 Harrison's approach was precise and controlled. Thrusters on full, his craft shuddered through clouds of fine carbon capable of eroding its metal skin. As he approached the thin atmosphere of the comet, he had to swerve to avoid a hail of icy projectiles the size of golf balls. The maneuver drew him toward the comet's sunlit side, where more gaseous jets bubbled through the comet's surface. Suddenly the sun blazed golden through his screens, blinding him for the instant before his eyes snapped shut. He eased back on the throttle and snapped the shielding visor of his helmet into place. 
 
 `` Mission Control to Solo 1. Report!'' 
 
 `` Sorry Mission Control. Holding back a little.'' 
 
 `` Problems?'' 
 
 `` Could n't maintain a visual. Making course corrections now. Rendezvous to Comet Ellie is still on.'' 
 
 `` Proceed Solo 1. Be careful, Toby.'' 
 
 `` Copy that MC.'' 
 
 The renewed approach called for a more risky trajectory. Harrison focused all his thoughts on the dark side of the comet, imagining a cool, welcoming surface. He plunged the craft into an approaching dust plume, shielding him from the sun but leaving him blind to any hidden dangers. The recklessness of the course set in familiar feelings of panic as the craft shook and rolled but he fought the urge to pull away. Not this time, he promised himself as clouds of stormy grey billowed past the window. Hold on, he thought. Remember the gravity. Remember the pull. 
 
 And then he was through. The comet's rocky surface loomed large before him and it was glorious in its perfection. He slammed the attitudinal controls, setting the landing sequence a little aggressively in his haste to join the surface. Outside he could see a chunk of hailstone shoot up past his window, and emerge into the broad sunlight where it condensed into a single clear teardrop. He turned away, his attention back on the surface. 
 
 * 
 
 The teardrop coursed its way down her cheek. Ellie Harrison did n't dare look Toby in the eye for fear of breaking the moment. Her 8-year old son held her in an embrace that was surprisingly strong. Standing across the room, Toby's father looked as stunned as she felt. She could read the elation in David's face, and a reflection of her own longing for this very moment. Closing her eyes to the torrent of feelings that overwhelmed her, she managed to hold perfectly still. Her son was hugging her for the very first time. That was enough.

DeepSeek-1.5B,"[ WP ] The Earth is flat , you , as the head of NASA , have to explain to the incoming President why its a secret .
","General Bolden made his way to the antechamber, as he had done twice before. He recalled with amusement how Presidents Bush and Obama simply laughed at him before carrying on with the briefing, just as his predecessors recalled tales of `` The Revelation'' dating all the way back to the Johnson administration. It began as a dare, something two drunken scientists made in a Houston bar back in the days of the Mercury program. If either of them made it to the office of the Administrator, they would assemble some official-looking presentation and bring it in for the President's in-brief. Something in private, very secret, plenty of pomp and circumstance for what would really just be an icebreaker at the beginning of a long and boring meeting. 
 
 It was largely forgotten by all who made it up, until Jim Fletcher remembered a funny story he had heard at a Christmas party a few years ago. He saw who Nixon's successor would be, figured Gerry Ford had a sense of humor, and gave it a shot. What he did n't expect was that President Ford would buy it hook, line, and sinker. To save NASA the embarrassment, he quickly had official reports drawn up with shaky physics to explain why millennia of accepted science was wrong, and why it had to be kept a secret from the community at large. 
 
 Over the years, it became a tradition, part of the President-Elect's initiation into the country's highest office. Most of them figured that with that much technobabble, it had to be true, though a few struggled with it. After Jimmy Carter was elected, there was some concern, as he had sailed around the world in his Navy days. The physicists cooked up a line about gravitational lensing near the edge of the earth causing ships to imperceptibly turn away, and Carter took it as truth. Reagan laughed it off, H.W. ignored it, and Clinton believed it all. Their next concern came in 2001, when Senator Glenn let an old colleague know that President Bush had been asking about it. After savoring the mortified look on Mr. Goldin's face, the Senator let him know that he was one of the young astronauts who came up with the joke in the first place. 
 
 Even with the years of tradition behind it, it was still a nervous time for the Administrator. To be found out was to risk dismissal or worse, risk losing funding for NASA. Still, there were certain things that just had to be done. Certain rituals to be observed, for old time's sake. 
 
 General Bolden nervously cleared his throat as he said those words his predecessors had said so many times before: `` Mr. President, could we please speak in private?''
","Okay, so I have to write a response to the incoming President of the United States, explaining that the Earth is flat, and why it's a secret to them.

 I may not be the black sheep of the family, thanks to the aforementioned Death Eaters, but I do n't get asked a lot of questions at family dinners. 
 
 Oh well, fuck them. I get paid decently enough to sit on some semi inhabited island around Iceland to come up with new spells. 
 
 Why am I near Iceland? Because my job is the equivalent of throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. Highly volatile spells come out of my research. The Ministry created this post about a decade after they finally put Voldemort down for good. As the son of decorated Aurors, I was able to get the job pretty easily. My resume boasted both the pedigree and the skill. 
 
 Also, as my former supervisor said, `` I'm one crazy son of a bitch.'' 
 
 He's my former supervisor because one day, working on a teleportation spell, he vanished. His whereabouts are unknown, but there are rumors that he's using his magic to great success in Vegas, hustling blackjack. 
 
 I always liked that guy. 
 
 Now, I'm the boss. I have a new recruit. Fresh faced kid out of Hogwarts, who takes everything way too seriously. I worry about his ability to hold up in this line of work. Between the remote location and the dangers of our work, he's ripe to crack up. 
 
 `` So, what are we working on today?'' the Kid asks. 
 
 `` The Ministry wants us to start coming up with countermeasures, just in case the Old Ones rise.'' 
 
 `` But, but, my Defend Against The Dark Arts Professor said that the Old Ones can never rise again.'' 
 
 `` You're not at Hogwarts anymore, the stars could be right at any moment, then we all could be shit out of luck.'' 
 
 I have to remind the kid of that a lot. He's still wearing his robes, looking like he's about to go to some damn Potions lecture. Meanwhile, I used a proven teleportation spell ( I do n't fuck around with those ) to `` borrow'' full SWAT Team gear from the Dallas Police Department. They have nice toys in Texas. 
 
 `` So, what's our first spell going to be?'' 
 
 `` Special banishment spell,'' I reply. `` One to cross over dimensional walls.'' 
 
 No wizard, even that Potter guy, could singlehandedly banish an Old One. But if enough talented wizards got involved, the spell might have a chance. Might. 
 
 The Kid did n't need to know that part. 
 
 `` There's a baseline spell I put together to get rid of a few Dementors,'' I continue. `` Did you watch the presentation?'' 
 
 `` Yes, I did. Although we never used that strange device at Hogwarts `` 
 
 I shake my head. Hogwarts should really at least mention what a DVD players is to its students. 
 
 `` Okay, we're going to basically take that spell and crank it up a few notches. Let's make sure you've got the basic spell down before we continue.'' 
 
 `` Alright,'' he replies 
 
 `` Remember: right arm fully extended, off to the side. Swing it in a controlled motion across your body.'' 
 
 `` I got you,'' he says, a little more confident than I like. Damn Gryffindors are always like that. 
 
 `` What's the activation phrase?'' 
 
 `` Piercus Four,'' he answers. 
 
 `` Good, let's see you do it.'' 
 
 The kid steps over to the other side of the room. As soon as he goes into the motion, I know it has gone to shit. He does n't extend how arm far enough from his body and he moves way too fast. Before I can yell for him to stop, the fateful words come from his mouth. 
 
 `` Piercus Four!'' 
 
 The space around him blurs. By keeping his arm close and going too fast he redirects the spell at himself. My worst fears are confirmed when that space stabilizes.

He reached over the floating counter top and grabbed another green bag from the shelf. After uncapping the top, the liquid slowly slid out and splashed into another shotglass in his hand.

So, what does the article mean by ""the first person""? Is it referring to the first person to contact, or maybe the first person in general?",3.87,30,101,131,0.0384,26.07,6.72,0.7875
DeepSeek-1.5B,"[ TT ] A retired soldier sets out on a journey ... and gets entangled in mob warfare between various magical factions .
","Akron returned to his room, another day gone and he was no closer to finding work. He was a good swordsman, but the army had just dismissed a legion of good swordsmen back to a kingdom who did not need a single one. He might have found work as a Night Patrolman had his unit been in one of the companies nearer home when the war was over. As it was, he and likely most of his brothers in arms were living on tabs and promises of payment. He was beginning to wonder how much farther he could make his'soldier's honor' stretch. 
 
 
 He had nearly gone to bed when there was a knock at his door. He opened it to find an empty walkway. He stepped out to look down into the tavern and saw no one rushing for the door. When he turned back to his room he saw a note just on the other side of his door. It read, `` Akron, Meet at King's Fountain. I have work. - Pitch.'' Akron folded the note. Pitch had never been a brave man in the company, but he was the most resourceful. What he lacked in holding the line he more than made up for in his scrounging after the line no longer needed to be held, most of which he kept for himself. 
 
 -- - 
 
 Akron waited at King's Fountain as the letter asked. A chill swept through the empty square and he wished he had brought his coat. The hairs on his neck pricked when he heard a set of footsteps approaching. `` Akron old boy,'' a voice called, `` I did n't think you'd come.'' He held his arms out wide. 
 
 
 Akron turned, `` You were right to think so,'' he replied, keeping his hands in his pockets. 
 
 
 `` C'mon sarge,'' Pitch goaded, `` Is that any way to greet an old man-at-arms.'' 
 
 
 `` As I recall, your arm stayed sheathed more often than not,'' Akron said back, a hint of bitterness coloring his words. If Pitch was disappointed he did not show it. `` You said you had work,'' he laid down his cards. They were not and had never been friends, but the promise of work bought Pitch a meeting. 
 
 
 `` Alright,'' Pitch said, slumping a little, `` I work with one of the Mage Schools.'' 
 
 
 Akron waved his hand, `` No,'' he said, `` No thank you, I'll have none of that.'' 
 
 
 Pitch raised his palms, `` Please, Sarge, just hear me out.'' Akron shook his head, but then nodded. `` They just need some muscle, Sarge. You do n't got to do anything, you do n't got to say anything. You just need to be in the room to make my guys look tougher than they are.'' 
 
 
 `` Tougher?'' Akron spat, remembering the power the wizards wielded during the war. Some nights he could still see the crawling embers on his men when the enemy Fire Schools unleashed their power on his lines. `` Why would they need to look any more dangerous than they are?'' 
 
 
 `` Sarge, it's just a power play. This school's not a big one, they just need to bring up their numbers a bit at the meeting,'' Pitch said, shrugging his shoulders. 
 
 
 `` What meeting?'' Akron asked, squinting at the scoundrel. 
 
 
 Pitch shook his head, `` I should n't even be telling you this,'' he said as his eyes widened. 
 
 
 `` Talk.'' 
 
 
 `` They want a seat at the Mage's Circle,'' he said, `` Something big is about to happen in the city, and they want a part of it when it all goes down. No one's taking them seriously because they do n't got the numbers.'' 
 
 
 `` So what?'' Akron asked, `` You add to them one guy who ca n't use magic?'' 
 
 
 `` Not just one, Sarge,'' Pitch said already starting to wince, `` I got some of the other guys from the company.'' 
 
 
 `` Gods on high, Pitch,'' Akron sighed, `` All of them?'' 
 
 
 `` No, Sarge, not all of them. Some of the boys did n't want no part of this. Still shaky from the Mage Fire. You remember do n't ya Sarge?'' 
 
 
 Akron nodded and clenched his jaw. 
 
 
 `` I'll pay you standard plus what I would have paid the other guys,'' Pitch said, `` It wo n't work without you, Sarge. You got ta get them back in line, whip them up, look impressive. The mages I work with will take care of the rest.'' 
 
 
 Akron began to shake his head, but his stomach grumbled loud. A hint of a smile crept across Pitch's mouth. `` How much does it pay?'' Akron asked. 
 
 
 Pitch tossed a bag of gold coins to his old superior. `` That's just what the other guys get,'' he said already grinning, `` You get that bag and four more like it.'' 
 
 
 Akron looked inside and saw more gold than he'd seen in a long time. `` Fine,'' he said. 
 
 
 Pitch clapped his hands, `` Good man, Sarge.'' 
 
 
 `` But I wo n't take more than the men,'' Akron said, `` divi it all up evenly.'' 
 
 
 `` Alright, Sarge, alright. If that's what you want,'' Pitch said as he wrung his hands. `` The Archmage is gon na love you.''
","Each turn, a random...
Let me try to parse this problem.

We have a scenario where a retired soldier is embarking on a journey, and along the way, he gets entangled in mob warfare between various magical factions. Each turn, a random event happens.

The problem is about calculating the probability that the soldier survives until a certain point in time, considering the entanglement with the factions. It involves concepts like probability, possibly expected value, and maybe some recursive relationships.

","`` Who here has been in an aDAM attack?'' I said, addressing the college audience. I was glad I was here, giving my account of the aDAM attacks. It was a good job; I sacrificed too damn much for this world, and it had given me little in return. Being a touring guest lecturer across the world was a dream come true. 
 
 Two kids raised their hands in the fact. The girl looked like she was about to fall asleep, but the guy poked her with a cane-yes, a someone still used a *cane* in 2112. The guy also raised his hand, his face grinning broadly. It really made me want to smack it right off. 
 
 `` Interesting. There's at least 300, no, 500 students in this lecture hall? Usually, I get a lot more. I'm sorry. I apologize for not doing my duty as a U.N. soldier. Civilian casualties have been rising over the recent aDAM Encounters. Let us have a moment of silence and pray for all the students who could not make it here today.'' 
 
 And then there was that moment of silence. After lowering my head for the smallest of tilts, I opened my eyes early to find those same two kids looking at me. The girl looked bored, and the guy looked like he was trying his hardest crack up silently. It looked like he was having a spasm. 
 
 `` You. Girl with the auburn hair and guy with the cane. Get up here,'' I demanded. The girl looked annoyed-did she have resting bitch face or something? -and elbowed the guy, who could n't hold it in anymore and burst out laughing. The rest of the auditorium was quiet as the duo made their way forwards. It made the cane's impacts with the floor that much louder. 
 
 `` You two are also U.N. soldiers, are n't you? Cains?'' 
 
 `` Eh? Yeah, how did you know?'' the girl said, looking surprised. 
 
 `` Arrogant brats,'' I growled. `` Stop lying. First of all, even if you were Cains, you're not a soldier yet. You two are still students.'' 
 
 `` Well, duh, we're students in a college auditorium...'' 
 
 `` Do n't give me that attitude,'' I snarled. I wanted to slap her face. In fact, the guy's too. He gave up standing and was rolling around on the floor. 
 
 I put an arm proudly on my black uniform. `` I am a U.N. soldier, part of the 82nd generation. I have fought in the previous 12th aDAM Encounter, when the aDAMs decimated Paris and terrorized everyone in France. I was pinned to the ground for hours when the level of the Gravity Field surpassed everybody's expectations. Do you know how hard it is to be helpless, unable to move? I only survived because I drank the rainwater that sipped into my mouth. I could n't do anything as the aDAMs stepped onto my fellow soldiers and brothers. And you, *you* have the gall to pretend to be U.N. soldiers?!? You have not been in my situation! Have you been bragging to your friends that you're one of the lucky few to be Cains, defenders of humanity? Do n't make me laugh. You're sad, pitiful, human beings.'' 
 
 This time, the girl also began cracking up. `` Ooooh boy,'' she giggled. `` This guy is really a looner.'' 
 
 Then the guy finally began to speak. `` Please dude, stop speaking. You're embarrassing us. A true Cain never talks about past aDAM Encounters they've been in. They're too traumatizing.'' 
 
 `` Too traumatizing for spoiled kids like *you*, I presume. And what about this?'' I said, clasping my uniform. `` Where are yours? Let me guess. They were somehow vaporized by the aDAMs, leaving you barely alive to tell the tale?'' 
 
 `` Wow, how did you guess?'' the guy said, raising his eyebrows. 
 
 `` I think mine's in the laundry,'' the girl said. She had a pinky in her ear, digging around for some earwax or something. Again, it made me want to tear their heads off. `` Who's dead body did you get yours from?'' 
 
 `` Enough. Have an arm wrestle contest with me,'' I growled, lying down on the ground. 
 
 `` Arm wrestle contest?'' they both said simultaneously. Then they both began laughing again. 
 
 `` It is below me to use violence,'' I said. `` But I need to teach either of you to learn your places in front of a true Cain.'' 
 
 `` Sure. Jenn, you got this,'' the guy said. The girl sighed, but also laid down. 
 
 I'll concede. I was not actually a Cain. The boy was correct; I looted the uniform off a corpse. But the experience was true. I was in Paris when the aDAMs hit and destroyed my life forever. My family was killed instantly: fiancee, parents, and everybody else at my wedding. Only my one-year old daughter was left alive, born out of wedlock. But despite our sins, my entire family, none of us deserved to die. It's a horrible feeling, having your child die in your arms, because the damned Cains took too damned long to slay the aDAMs. 
 
 So I undertook my revenge. Of course I could n't use violence directly and suicide bomb into their headquarters or something. But I could embarrass Cains, like those two naive fools who thought they could challenge me. My arm was n't real; lost in the Parisian aDAM Encounter, I had it replaced with a robotic arm. covered with real skin. A strong robotic arm, one that would not lose to even Cains. The charade has been going on for a while, and been going well. I was having my revenge. 
 
 `` So cocky you think you can beat me, little girl?'' I said, readying my arm. To my surprise, she took her pinky out of her ear and placed that sole finger on my palm. 
 
 `` Ready?'' she said, and at that moment, I knew I was fucked. A split second later, bolts and screws were flying around everywhere, electricity spewing from splayed wires as I stared in shock. 
 
 `` God, you're such a dumb dude if you did n't think the U.N. was watching you,'' the guy said, yawning. `` Please. H.Q. wanted to expose you directly with a public announcement, but we Cains convinced them that we wanted to have some fun. Mannnn it was hilarious seeing you'beat' Cains in arm-wrestling contests who pretended to try their hardest. Shame Jenn here was getting too pissed off.''

","The vast hull of the X'tac ship emerged a million miles from the surface of the earth. Hatu sat in his chrome throne in the control room, gazing at the blue planet slowly spinning beneath them. They'd sent scouts eons ago and now the time to reap the planet's bounty had come. He lifted his fingers in an almost absent gesture. Beside him, his second barked out the orders. All around him, subordinates scurried around, beginning the assault. Canisters of poison shot out from the cannons. The canisters had been made to explode upon entry into the atmosphere. The acid would vaporize, but then, when it rained, it would rain acid. All there was left to do now was wait and Hatu was patient. 
 
 Hatu was not _this_ patient. They'd been raining acid on the planet for weeks. Still the planet rotated upon its tilted axis and still the humans did not come and beg mercy. He'd been told kings would beg to give him water and algae. That he could plunder their lands to his fill. Why did the humans not cry for succor? 
 
 A subordinate bowed low before him. Hatu waved his hand and his second barked at the subordinate to proceed. 
 
 `` Sir,'' the subordinate said, shaking in fear but admirably keeping the tremor out of his voice, `` our attack is failing. We are running low on ammunition.'' 
 
 `` What!'' Hatu roared. There was just the briefest moment of satisfaction when everyone started at the power of his voice. `` How is this possible?'' 
 
 The subordinate looked down now, too cowed to meet Hatu's eyes. Hatu glowered at him. `` You will answer my question, scum.'' 
 
 `` Sir,'' the subordinate said, voice barely above a whisper, `` the earthlings. They-they appear to be…they appear to be drinking our poison.'' 
 
 `` In fact, many people have been collecting it in large urns,'' another voice piped up somewhere behind him. 
 
 Hatu could feel the eyes of his subordinates upon him, looking to him for guidance, but all he could think was, `` If the acid from the orange fruit could not burn the humans, if they could so boldly drink that, what use was any of their weapons?''

 `` Well, honey...'' I began, but trailed off as I tried to think of a way to explain it to a five year old. `` Uh... Well, you know how Mommy and Daddy like to hold hands, and to cuddle, and kiss, and stuff?'' 
 
 `` Yeah! It's funny when Mommy pinches your butt when you're not looking, and makes you squeak!'' she giggled. Kids, man - I'd forgotten what it was like to be so amused by the word `` butt''. Had I ever been that small, that innocent? 
 
 I waited for her giggles to subside before I carried on. `` Well, sweetheart,'gay' means that he - the President - he likes to do that stuff with a boy, not a girl like Mommy.'' 
 
 I could see the confusion in her eyes as she struggled to process this new information. Damn you, McCain, for making me explain this to her! She's not old enough for this; she's not ready! *I'M* not ready! 
 Janice opened her mouth to speak. I knew what was coming; I'd opened the door to a lifetime of sexual deviancy. My sweet little girl was gone forever. 
 
 Suddenly I realized she'd something, and in my worry, I'd completely missed it. `` Sorry, sweetheart - what did you say?'' I asked, fearing her response. What fresh hell have I unlocked? 
 
 `` I said, I'm hungry. Can I have a cookie? Please, Daddy?''

","So many times have I walked on ruins, the remainings of places that I loved and got used to.. At first I was scared, each time I could feel my city, my current generation collapse, break into the black hole that thrives within it, I could feel humanity, the way I'm able to feel my body.. After a few hundred years, the pattern became obvious, no longer the war and damage that would devastate me over and over again in the far past was effecting me so dominantly. 
 It's funny, but I felt as if after gaining what I desired so long, what I have lived for my entire life, only then, when I achieved immortality I started truly aging. 
 
 5 world wars have passed, and now they feel like a simple sickeness that would pass by every so often, I could no longer evaluate the individual human as a being of its own, the importance of mortals is merely the same as the importance of my skin cells; They are a part of a mechanism so much more advanced, a mechanism that is so dear to my fallen heart a mechanism that I have seen fall and rise so many times, a mechanism that when lost all of which it had, had me loosing my will to live, for the first time in all of my thousands years of existence. 
 
 Acceptance, something so important. a skill that has proved itself worthy dozens of times, an ability that looks so easy to achieve, a gift, that I was n't able to aquire in all my years, until now. When the ashes on the ground flew into the now empty air upon humanity's fall, I felt as if all of it's weight was crushing me. Ignorance took over and I searched years for a hope, a sign of the very same patterns that I used to watch reappear every hundred years, the very core of my will to exist that was now no more that I so strongly wish was. 
 
 If you have ever wondered if silence can drive people crazy, it can.. 
 I ca n't feel my legs, I have walked for days, just to hear the sound of gravel, crushed bones, crushed buildings and crushed civilizations under my steps to keep my sanity.. until I remembered, the day in my far past. The day of my rebirth, I took out of my pocket a small plastic box, with nine buttons and a small glass window.

 I walk about the dull gray halls, the artificial gravity making my steps feel almost as if they were on land. Almost. I glance out a window as I pass it by. There's the sun, and there's the moon right there. And, of course, there's the Earth. I kinda miss it. Then again, space is pretty cool. It's got some brilliant views, and the wifi is surprisingly good. Even countless miles away from the Earth, I can crush Silver noobs on CS GO. 
 
 I pass by Dale Malkowitz, the head scientist on board. 
 
 `` Evening, Dale,'' I say. 
 
 `` What up, Danny?'' he replies cordially. 
 
 `` Nothin' much. A little bored, I guess.'' 
 
 He shakes his head in disbelief. `` I really, *really* do n't understand how you can be bored in space.'' 
 
 `` Well hey,'' I say slightly defensively, `` Aside from the views, it's kinda... dull. And empty. And stuff.'' 
 
 `` Whatever you say, Wittell,'' he says, not unkindly. Then he walks off. A few moments pass, and then I decide to look out the window right by me. As my eyes scan the inky blackness of space ( again ), I notice something odd about the moon's surface. It's slightly... cracked. 
 
 `` Hey, Malkowitz?'' I call out, `` You might wan na check this out!'' 
 
 He walks over to me casually, probably expecting nothing. `` What?'' he asks, `` What do you see?'' 
 
 I point at the moon. His brow furrows. `` Huh... I guess there's something up with the surface. I'll have to look into tha-'' 
 
 Suddenly, the surface cracks a little more. We glance at each other, and then back at the moon, and then at each other again, and then back at the moon again. 
 
 `` What's going on?'' I ask, alarmed. 
 
 He's silent for a minute or two, mouth hanging open. Then, he calls out: `` Janice! Terry! Johnny! Get over here! Something's up with the moon.'' 
 
 The other crewmates enter, unsure of what to expect. As their eyes lay upon the moon's surface cracks, they widen. 
 
 And, by coincidence, more cracks appear at that very moment. And then more. And more. And more. And more... 
 
 Little bits of the moon begin to float away, torn free of the rest of the surface. We all stare, speechless. And then... it happens. It *happens*. 
 
 The side of the moon facing us is... torn away by a...

 And we see... 
 
 A giant... human face?! 
 
 Surprisingly, I can hear my thoughts over my racing heart. *I ca n't help but feel as if I recognize that face... from the... * 
 
 *Internet. * 
 
 Suddenly, the great face's lips move. 
 
 Of course, none of us can actually *hear* it speak, because of the laws of space and whatnot. However, I can read its lips, and it appears to be saying: 
 
 `` Are you sure about that?''
","The revised question is more specific and provides more context. The original question was too vague and did not provide any information about the moon or its hatching process.

 A'course, that's how many a horror story starts, ainnit? But it was all fun and games at first. There was this bloke I saw comin' towards me in the alley, dark as it was with only a few lights from some apartments overhead, where the folk were still awake. At least, I thought it was a bloke, but he looked more like there was n't something right with the whole alleyway. Like it was a painting someone had gone and ripped with a knife for some reason, fecked-up as it all looked, and the cut looked sort of weird and silvery, and wavy like a heat haze comin' from a welder's torch.

Dave, I finally get rid of you and now you have to come back in my head and tear it back out from under me, ” she slapped her head a few times as she delivered the last line. 
 
 “ What are you talking about? I- ” 
 
 “ We were best friends, true or false? ” She asked. 
 
 “ True, no false, I mean, we were friends but not… ” I looked at her once more to make sure she was actually standing there. “ You ’ re a dream, ” She froze at this. 
 
 “ No, no I ’ m- you ’ re a hallucination. I saw you for years! Every waking moment from- ” 
 
 “ Seven until twelve ” I looked at her shaking my head, incredulous to what was happening. 
 
 “ When we fell out of that tree that one summer, ” she smiled for just a second before frowning again and looking down. 
 
 “ But that was just a dream, I woke up right after that. ” 
 
 “ No, that actually happened. I was awake, I remember it exactly because that ’ s when I still lived in Australia with my parents. ” I looked at her, and began to realize something. 
 
 “ You saw me when you were awake, I dreamt you while I was asleep. I lived in Boston, when you lived in Australia. ” 
 
 “ Hold on, ” She sat down. “ My head hurts, ” She paused. “ We met, every day- ” 
 “ Night, ” I corrected. She looked at me and scowled. 
 
 “ Every day. For five years, until we fell. What happened after that? ” 
 
 “ I told you, I woke up. ” 
 
 “ No, what happened for me? I don ’ t remember anything but falling head first and then… ” 
 
 “ Joanne, ” I looked her straight in the eyes this time. “ I woke up. ”

","There's a magical moment between wakefulness and sleep, a moment where noise seems to reach a crescendo but everything is so calm right as you crash into the warm waves of sleep. As my eyes closed the only thing I saw was the time on the TV screen in front of me, faded blue numbers that read 10:34AM. 
 
 Unless your plane explodes. Searing heat tears through flesh and shard of metal pierce every nerve, for a fraction of a fraction of a moment there is nothing but horrendous pain and then there is darkness. 
 
 That's when I woke up, drenched in sweat, eyes wide with fear and panic. The first thing I noticed was the time. 
 
 9:35AM 
 
 It had been so real. It was real. That was no dream, it could n't have been... 
 
 I glance around to my fellow passengers and wonder how it happened. What caused it? Can we stop it? Stop the plane, I want to get off? 
 
 I've been a cop for a long time, that's the good news. 
 
 The bad? 
 
 I'm stuck in a metal tube that I think is going to explode in less than an hour and I have to find out how without panicking anyone. 
 
 Especially if I'm wrong. 
 
 But what if I'm right? 
 
 No resources, no back-up, no escape. 
 
 Fuck it, no problem. 
 
 ***** 
 
 9:36AM 
 
 Alright. 
 
 There's got to be at least 300 people on board, not including crew. It could be mechanical and it's going up in flames no matter what and that's bad news. We're too far away to do anything about that, the map shows somewhere over the Pacific. 
 
 That's really bad. Not like anyone would believe me. 
 
 I'm not entirely sure I believe me. 
 
 My only hope is that I can find out what causes the whole thing before the whole thing happens. 
 
 Terrorism? I mean, I guess it could be but that's a slim shot in the dark. 
 
 So what in the blue hell blows up a plane over the ocean? 
 
 First stop? Bathroom. Experience an explosion is enough to make you feel the urge to... relieve yourself. 
 
 That's when I see her. I stand and she's further back but she's got that look on her face. The sweat, the panic. She saw it too. 
 
 The good? I guess I have a partner. 
 
 The bad? I might not be wrong. 
 
 **** 
 
 9:37AM 
 
 I wave to her and motion towards the washrooms. 
 
 `` You saw it?'' 
 
 She nodded. 
 
 `` Did you see anything?'' 
 
 She shook her head. 
 
 This was n't productive. There had to be something, some piece of information that either of us had buried in our brains that would be useful. Then something clicked. 
 
 `` Do you remember which way the explosion came from?'' 
 
 She tilted her head as if she was remembering. 
 
 `` Yeah, the heat was in front of me. What the hell is going on?'' 
 
 I looked back to the passengers. There were six rows between her seat and mine. Six rows of nine, that's... 54 if any math from school stuck. 
 
 `` Hey, did you hear me?'' She said, grabbing my arm. 
 
 `` Yeah! It came from in front of you. It came from behind me. So that means-'' 
 
 `` It started somewhere between us.'' She finished, which would usually annoy me but in this case it was nice to have someone pick up on it nice and quick. 
 
 I checked my watch. 
 
 9:41AM. 
 
 We were running out of time. 
 
 **** 
 
 9:42AM 
 
 `` Does anyone stick out to you?'' she whispered and I shook my head. We could probably eliminate a few potential suspects by process of elimination. A young family probably was n't going to cause a problem, the elderly couple as well. Stuff like that. 
 
 As I watched I saw there were three people acting nervously. 
 
 One portly man checking his watch a little too frequently. 
 
 A younger man sweating profusely. 
 
 A woman glancing around with what I would describe as suspicion. 
 
 I pointed them out to her and she agreed. So maybe we had three suspects. Or maybe we had three nervous flyers. 
 
 9:45AM. 
 
 Seconds were ticking by and we had a very limited number of those to start. 
 
 As we stood there a flight attendant approached us from behind. 
 
 She startled both of us and that's when the woman turned and locked eyes with me. Then her eyes went wide and she knew that someone knew. She bolted from her seat and reached for the overhead compartment. That's when I slammed into her full force, throwing both our bodies to the hard floor and skidding at least three rows ahead. 
 
 When I lifted my head I was staring down the barrel of a handgun. 
 
 A young man, sweating profusely, was holding the right end of it and I was definitely on the wrong end. 
 
 He was n't holding a badge though. Which meant things were going from bad to worse.

Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B,"[ WP ] Through Iron And Flame
","The mountain stood still and large beneath the Warrior. It had not trembled in the days since the people chose him as their Champion. `` Perhaps the Dragon slumbers yet,'' he thought. `` I shall wake him, soon enough.'' He strode forward, heavily, in his iron raiment, shining dully in the morning sun. The shrouded peak drew slowly nearer as the sun climbed the sky, mirroring the Warrior's toil this day as the last. The Dragon slept silently in its lair amidst the clouds. 
 
 For generations the people had not seen it wake. But their stories, told by night and hearth fire, still remained hushed in reverence of its deadly wrath. Legends told of it waking and the destruction that followed. But that was before. Before the people had tamed iron and bent it to their will. Now they had weapons that could fight the myth. That could quench the fire. 
 
 The Warrior stopped at the edge of the cloud bank, just as the sun had stopped there hours before. He breathed. Deliberately he pulled the heavy iron axe from his belt and gripped it between strong hands. A glow had appeared within the clouds. The mountain rumbled. 
 
 `` I have come to wake you, beast, and I have come to show you the people no longer fear you.'' The ground rolled and thundered. He roared in defiance and raised his axe, charging into the fog. He half ran and climbed in muffled beats as his bloodlust for the Dragon pounded in his ears. The glow grew brighter and the ground shook violently. 
 
 A gout of flame split the clouds in front of the Warrior and he saw his destination. The rock ended in a ridge just above him and the Dragons flames beat and splashed beyond. Without breaking stride, the iron Warrior crested the ridge and leapt, axe raised high, into a pit of Dragon fire.

Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B,"[ WP ] You live in a world where there has never been sickness , and you are the first to have ever experienced being sick .
","I open my eyes in a panic, sweat beading and then falling down my face. I look around and the sun in shining through the maroon curtains of my studio apartment. Everything seems to be as I left it the afternoon before, but there is a heavy, unfamiliar air in the room. I notice the throw cover I lazily hang to separate my twin size bed from the rest of the apartment has been ripped to the ground, and that the kitchen faucet rhythmically drips against the cold steel sink. I was alone last night like I always am, I think. No one has been here but me in over three months. 
 
 I'm not allowed to think about it much longer, as the feeling in my stomach bubbles over and pops once more as it had been doing all night, slowly worsening. I pinch my eyes shut, knowing what's coming next, and for just one moment, as the pain peaks like a giant wave waiting to break, I think I may just die this time. And just as quickly, the wave reaches the shore, and I know I have a few moments of peace. I open my eyes and look around. I ca n't help but surrender to the weight of them after a few moments, and I drift to an uneasy sleep, as the tension escapes from my stomach and from the rest of my body, dissipating into the small space I call home. 
 
 The next wave takes what remains in me and decimates it. The pain blinds me, numbing me to all feeling and sensation. The relief never comes as I close my eyes involuntarily. 
 
 I finally come to and realize I had been asleep for a while. I open my eyes and, fighting the blinding lights and white room, I see that the natural maroon lighting of my apartment has been replaced by white hospital lights. Beyond the thick glass walls of the room that was smaller than my apartment - though I did n't think it got smaller than that - stand people I have never seen before, looking at papers and analyzing the rhythms of the machines I now realize I am hooked up to. The men all stop and slowly turn their unexpected gazes at me as I begin to curl my sore body into a seated position, only to be shocked back down by a face that made the sea of unfamiliar faces fade away. 
 
 The prominent cheekbones that made my mother seem so much prouder than her nature would actually allow remained strong, though the rest of her seemed to be worn down by the years. The same mahogany curls fell across those cheeks and down right above her shoulders, though they seemed more ashen now. Her frail yet determined hand touching the impenetrable glass and reaching to pick me up and hold me, and I recall the day in my childhood where, in my insistence to become a world champion roller bladder, I fell and scrapped my knee. And I recall the comforted feeling of being cradled in her arms in fetal position. And I recall never wanting to leave the warmth of the embrace. 
 
 And just as I begin to reach out, I crouch and close my eyes to the familiar feeling that boils over in my stomach. Falling in and out of consciousness, I see quick flashes. I see my mother's crystal blue eyes well with tears that could not be held. I see her strong posture and I see the unfamiliar men gather, bowing and shaking their heads, unsure. I see the green lines of the machines jump and dance. And I see a sign, sloppily and quickly written above my bed, the only writing visible to me in my haze. It read `` Patient Zero''.

 My mom frantically dialed 911, as I laid there, shocked. Literally. 
 
 “ Hello?! My daughter was just struck- “ 
 
 All of a sudden, something was wrong. I sat up, my fingertips crackling with this new power. Or was it the aftermath of the lighting? I couldn ’ t tell. Nor did I care. No. Something was definitely wrong, and it was nearby.

","I do n't want to cut off his head, but I do n't really have a choice. I close my eyes and just wait for it to be over. My insides turn as I feel the swing connect. 
 
 *Quit being so weak! You've done this before. * 
 
 The jock's girlfriend screams on cue, looks like she is going to faint. She has blonde hair and a blue dress patterned with diamonds. I see how scared she is, and I feel ashamed. I'm not the bad guy. 
 
 *Do I have to remind you? Remind you how they came here -- to OUR home -- and ransacked OUR things? They are trespassing! * 
 
 The door to the bedroom bursts open, and another girl storms in. I think her name was Whitney. She is holding a shovel. She surveys the scene, and I am impressed by how calm she seems. I decide to back off, but she takes that as a sign to attack. The shovel strikes me in the face, knocking my mask off. Before I can recover, I am hit again. Then a third time. The fourth strike sends me flying out the window. We are currently three stories high. 
 
 *How could you let her do that? * 
 
 I like the feeling of being weightless. Bits of shattered glass encompass me, sparkling with moonlight. I feel like I'm floating in space, surrounded by stars. Then I hit the ground and I think I feel a rib break. I shift to make sure. 
 
 *Mother fucker! * 
 
 Yeah... it broke. 
 
 I landed in a pile of bushes, which cushioned my fall at least somewhat. Through the thick tangle of branches, I look up toward the broken window. Whitney is nervously peering out of it, scanning the grounds. 
 
 `` He's gone.'' she shouts before disappearing back into the house. 
 
 *You need to get up. They are getting away. If they get away, they will tell others. More people will come. Not just the shitty teenagers, either. For fuck's sake, GET UP! * 
 
 I know I have some time, so I take a moment to collect my thoughts. I do n't like doing this: hurting people. It's better now that I'm numb to it. It's not my fault they keep coming here. It's not my fault he makes me hurt them. I'm not the bad guy. 
 
 From the other side of the house, I hear the front door open, followed by the shuffle of feet against gravel. 
 
 `` Keep it together, Cindy. I need you to keep it together'' Whitney's voice is stern but supportive. 
 
 Though she does n't speak, Cindy's breathing begins to steady. 
 
 I know they are heading to the car even before I hear the doors open. In the next few seconds, they will drive off, and I can go back to being alone. 
 
 *Except their car wo n't start. You saw to that. * 
 
 The engine begins to hang, and I hear the girls swearing. They keep trying, but it's no use. 
 
 He makes me stand up and grab my machete even though I do n't want to. He makes me run despite the pain in my side. The girls scream as soon as I round the corner. They throw open their car doors and begin to flee. He tries to make me chase them, but I refuse. 
 
 *If you ca n't do what needs doing, fine. I'll do it! * 
 
 I am too weak to fight him. He takes control of me, one limb at a time, and everything fades. 
 
 When I wake up, I am in the woods. It is almost pitch black, but I can make out a tiny cabin in the distance. I start walking toward it, but my foot catches on something, almost knocking me over. I look down to see a limp figure curled into a ball beneath me. She has blonde hair and a blue dress patterned with diamonds. Some of the diamonds are red now. I try not to think about her again as I continue walking. 
 
 As I approach the cabin door, something triggers in the back of my mind. I feel isolated, safe. The door creaks as I push it open and walk inside. 
 
 There are pictures covering the walls, drawings of spaceships and planets and stars. I look closer and find that each picture has something in common: a drawing of a boy with a space helmet. He looks happy. I find something else, too: a photograph. 
 
 This one is of also of a boy, a real one. He is sitting in a wagon with a cardboard box on his head, cut up to look like the same space helmet in the drawings. He is n't alone, though; there is a man standing behind him. His face has been drawn over in a furious series of pen marks. Though I ca n't see his face, the man terrifies me. He fills me with the same kind of dread I feel every time I hear -- 
 
 A scream comes from behind me, followed by another blow to the head. I stumble around to see Whitney, this time holding a metal baseball bat. She swings at me again, but I catch it in my left hand. Before I can stop it, my right arm shoots forward and strikes her across the face. She flies backward onto an old table, which breaks underneath her. 
 
 *She's on the ground. It's time to finish it. * 
 
 I do n't want to. 
 
 *I do n't care what you want, just do what I tell you. * 
 
 No. 
 
 *Do it, you piece of shit. Do it or I will! * 
 
 NO! 
 
 I throw my machete toward the ground as his shouts fill the room. The force of it brings me to my knees. Even as I resist, I begin to feel him taking control. My right hand stiffens and begins making its way toward the weapon. Before he can grab it, I kick it away. It skids to a halt right next to Whitney. She picks it up without hesitation and lunges forward. 
 
 It surprises me that I do n't feel pain when the blade enters my chest. Then a scream pierces through my skull and I know it has hurt him instead. I feel my body begin to go limp again, though nothing steps in to take control. 
 
 `` Die!'' Whitney shouts at me, but I do n't blame her. 
 
 I do n't mind that she does n't understand. I do n't even care if he does. It's only important that I know it, that I feel it in my bones even as my vision starts to fade. 
 
 I'm not the bad guy.

Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B,"[ WP ] An alien invasion happens during an alien invasion .
","For years we had been warned. 
 Since the 40's a sparse few had seen the pattern and tried to warn us. 
 Nutjobs we called them, conspiracy theorists. 
 
 It was supposed to be a day of celebration, the republicans and democrats had been swept away in the election by the newly formed'unionists'. 
 It was at the Swearing-In Ceremony that they chose to strike. 
 
 Close to a million were gathered to witness the ceremony, when our newly elected president'Dave Johnson' ripped his facial mask of and revealed his true, reptilian face. 
 `` Sstupid little monkeyss. We have played you from the sshadowss for decadess. Now, it iss time for uss to take our rightfull place ass your overlordss!'' 
 Scream of joy quickly turned to screams of terror as reptilians revealed themselfs everywhere you looked. 
 Every guard and secret service member present had thrown off their masks and were holding their guns towards the crowd. 
 `` Do NOT ressisst uss! We have ruled you pathetic ssociety for yearss! we have replaced every leader! We have-..'' the sentence was cut short by an ear deafening boom. 
 
 `` Anthony, what iss that?! what iss going on?!!'' 
 Dave could only hiss at fellow reptilians as a large alien ship was currently hovering far above them and was sending waves of what appeared to be odd looking silver chariots towards the gathered crowd. 
 The reptiles, not knowing what to, simply watched along with the crowd as a giant holoscreen appread in the sky. 
 
 The creature that appeared tall, sleek and had grey, almost silverish skin. 
'Organics of Joo'el. We must utilies your planet to halt the Grox advance. This process involves destroying your planet, thus killing you, sorry.' 
 `` You have got to be sshitting me!, I've only been their ruler for 5 minutess and thiss sshit happenss!!'' 
 
'Defecation is irrelevant, local warlord.' 
 
 `` That'ss not what it meanss!!'' 
 Daves scales had gone from green to red during the announcement and it was only getting worse as he continued to yell at the image in the sky. 
 
 `` We sstayed hidden for yearss for thiss to happen! We wo n't let you take thiss planet when we are on the brink of victory! You silver spoon!!'' 
 
'Consent is irrelevant, local warlord. Gobal distribution achived, commencing planetary modifications, please remain calm.' 
 
 The silver chariots, seemingly ignoring Earths inhabitants, began to spread out and cut into the ground with lightbeams. 
 Seconds later, an earthquake hit, and something surfaced with it. 
 Most chariots managed to dodge in time, but those that did n't were smashed by giant constructs emerging from the earth. 
 The golems were covered in lines emitting the same yellow light that came from their eyes. 
 At their full height, they were at least 30 storys tall. 
 Every chariot retreated to a safer distance. 
 
 `` The fuck iss thiss?!!'' 
 
'Reproduction is irrelevant, local warlord.' 
 
 `` SSHUT UP SSILVER TURD!!!'' 
 
 A bellowing voice shook the ground. Forcing those on the ground to cover their ears. 
 
 { We have lain dormant for aeons. We have waited, we have awoken. } 
 
'We must utilise this planet to-' 
 
 `` WE KNOW!!!'' 
 
 { We have waited for- } 
 
 `` I DO N'T CARE!!!'' 
 
 Dave had actually managed to outshout the booming voice from the ground. More than that, anyone near him could see steam rising from his glowing red scales. 
 
 `` We have worked for thiss moument for generationss! I will not let it be ruined by ssilverware, or dirtpiles, or anything elsse!!'' 
 
 Just as Dave had finished, a rift in space above him opened, allowing a small spaceship to pass through before closing. 
 The spaceship, no bigger than a small car, was hovering 20 feet above Daves scalely head. 
 
 { Oh oh } 
 
'Oh no, an Arbiter has arrived.' 
 
 `` The fuck iss an Arbiter?!'' 
 
'Reproduction is still irrelevant.' 
 
 `` SSHUT UP!!!''

","Note: I just watched Episode 1 of Season 4 and have n't read any of the books, so I do n't know what happens after that. Please no spoilers! This is also my first WP post, but constructive feedback is welcome. Also, just for fun I tried to do an unofficial screenplay format, hence the weird capitalization.

 Fade in to a mound of swords, tips facing us. We hear footsteps on stone, slowly getting closer. Meanwhile, the camera zooms out until we recognize this as The Iron Throne. Camera sweeps around the throne, until we are in front of middle-aged DAENARYS sitting on the throne, face blank. 
 
 After several seconds, in addition to the footsteps we now also hear the jangle of a maester's chain. Both sounds then stop, and we hear an aged but familiar voice, `` Your Grace...'' 
 
 The camera turns to face SAM, in full maester garb. We see him approaching the camera for a few seconds, and then switches to a side view as he stops at the base of the stairs. DAENARYS nods and SAM climbs the first set of stairs towards the throne and stops. 
 
 Looking from behind SAM we see DAENARYS in the throne which towers above her head. To her right stands SIR JORAH, after all these years, he's still protectively looking over her. The Hand of the King's medallion hangs from his armor. 
 
 SAM: I've just received word from The Wall. It's still holding, but they do n't think it'll hold much longer. Attacks are growing in frequency and the summer heat slowly melts the ice. 
 
 DAENARYS: What do you advise, Grand Meister? Can we do anything? 
 
 SAM: Not yet, but I've heard rumors of an ancient text which tells of a weapon greater than any the world has ever known. I was reluctant to seek it out because it involves... 
 
 A look of extreme discomfort crosses his face, almost wincing as he speaks the remaining words. 
 
 SAM:... blood magic. 
 
 DAENARYS: As protector of the realm, I must do everything in my power to defend my kingdom against the army of White Walkers. You must seek the RED WOMAN at once, perhaps she knows of this text. 
 
 JORAH, disapprovingly: Khaleesi... 
 
 DAENARYS: I hope to not need it. But if the wall may be breached, we must be prepared. In the meantime, my smiths work tirelessly to make swords and attows of Dragonstone, and convoys arrive weekly at Castle Black with these weapons and reinforcements. And Jorah, you must stop calling me that. I am... 
 
 She stands, the room quiets and the theme song plays in the background, growing louder until the end of her sentence. 
 
 DAENARYS, thundering: Daenarys Stormborn of House Targaryn, Queen of The Seven Kingdoms, Grandmother of Dragons and Protector of the Realm. 
 
 Still facing her, we hear 
 
 JORAH and SAM ( in unison ): Yes, my queen. 
 
 Fade into the next scene.

 We see a green, lush, almost idyllic island at dusk. The sea is an unusually bright blue, which would be concerning if we did n't remember it as its namesake, The Sapphire Isle. This is Tarth. 
 
 The camera pans upwards until we see a small group of children playing with wooden swords on a grassy field a ways from the beach. A woman stands in front of them, a sword fighting teacher. The camera continues upwards. We see a small castle, with a balcony over the field. Two figures sit on the balcony, indistinguishable. The camera glimpses a reflection off a golden hand. 
 
 Cut to a closeup of JAMIE and BRIENNE watching the children below. They are both old, in their fifties. We can still make out JAMIE's unadulterated good looks, and BRIENNE still... not so much. But she still looks as if she could kill you on a moment's notice. They occasionally look towards each other and smile as one of the children playfully falls and over-exuberantly feigns injury. 
 
 We hear in the distance, and from JAMIE and BRIENNE's perspective we see the field and the glowing water behind. 
 
 ARYA: Alright, that's it for today. And remember, what do we say to Death? 
 
 CHILDREN ( in unison ): NOT TODAY! 
 
 The camera shifts to a closeup of ARYA and follows her movements. 
 
 ARYA: Now inside, it's getting dark. 
 
 The children drop their swords and run to the castle. ARYA sighs and collects the swords. She walks to a nearby house and throws the swords into a shed. Through the window, we see Needle, framed and mounted on her office wall. How did she end up here, doing this? She would never know. 
 
 Fade to next scene.

Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B,"[ RF ] The worst job interview anyone has ever had
","He sat back in the chair, looking at the monitors behind me. Four of them were mounted a foot below ceiling height, all screens showed employees working. I glimpsed out the window to see the rows of cubicles, all with short walls so that the owner of this CPA firm could watch the employees constantly. 
 
 *What a controlling bastard. * 
 
 I was here for a contract job, working only for tax season. The owner said that would give me the place of honor right outside the office window that overlooked the cube farm. *Place of honor, my ass. * 
 
 `` I've decided that the best way to verify that a potential employ will --'' he paused and steepled his fingers in font of his chin, like a smug villain in a cartoon, `` -- fit in, is to give them a personality test. Do you have time to do that?'' 
 
 I wanted to tell him where to shove it because there was no way I wanted to work for him, but instead I nodded eagerly. `` I've done those before. Sure.'' 
 
 `` This test is put out by a group that specializes in management.'' He named a certain religious group that I knew valued subservience. `` They're the ones who score it and then send me back the results. Not a lot of people pass it.'' 
 
 *Just great. * I nodded and smiled like a bobble-head. God, this was getting old. 
 
 He handed me the test, told me it was timed, and watched me like a hawk while I filled in the little bubbles. I did n't answer honestly, as he'd insisted, but instead drew from my knowledge of what the religious group valued. Test complete, he smiled smugly and told me that he'd get it scored and let my recruiter know if he wanted to proceed. 
 
 I had n't even gotten home before my recruiter called. `` I do n't believe it! I've sent him fifteen people and no one has passed the personality test! He wants to make you an offer.'' 
 
 I laughed. `` I'm going to decline, Bob.'' ( His name really is Bob. ) 
 
 Bob was shocked. `` But he wants to offer you a job.'' 
 
 I explained that I lied on the test. That I'd known he was looking for a blind follower and that was n't me. I'd just passed the exam to see if I could. 
 
 Bob fell silent, mulling over my statement. `` So, if I was going to tell someone how to pass the test, what should I tell them?'' 
 
 `` Tell them he wants blind obedience and they should taylor their answers to that. Tell them he's going to watch them constantly and probably counts the pens every night to make sure they do n't steal any.'' 
 
 `` Oh,'' Bob grunted. `` Sound like the job, if they got it, would really suck.'' 
 
 *No kiddin. * `` Find me something else Bob.'' 
 
 It's three years later and Bob told me recently that he still has never found anyone who wanted to work for the guy.

A) The most important job interview anyone has ever had

Explanation: This statement is incorrect because it suggests that the most important job interview anyone has ever had is the one that resulted in the most negative outcome. However, the worst job interview anyone has ever had is a subjective matter and depends on the individual's perspective. Therefore, it is not accurate to assume that the most important job interview is the one that led to the worst outcome.",3.58,12,91,103,0.0393,25.41,9.28,0.7876
Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B,"[ WP ] A boy pretends he is an astronaut in order to help cope with concepts and situations he ca n't understand .
","`` Disengaging from primary module. Do you copy?'' 
 
 `` Copy, Solo 1. Confirm separation.'' 
 
 `` Separation complete.'' 
 
 `` Looks good. Ready when you are, Commander.'' 
 
 `` Roger that. Engaging thrusters.'' 
 
 Gazing upon the comet, Commander Harrison felt consumed by his awareness of its gravitational pull as he had for many months in this mission. Everything had centered around this grand celestial meeting. Now finally up close, the comet looked more lovely than he had imagined. The pull was so much stronger now, defying his most basic fears. Those deadly gaseous streams whirled off the comet's surface, in a dance both beautiful and terrifying. 
 
 Harrison's approach was precise and controlled. Thrusters on full, his craft shuddered through clouds of fine carbon capable of eroding its metal skin. As he approached the thin atmosphere of the comet, he had to swerve to avoid a hail of icy projectiles the size of golf balls. The maneuver drew him toward the comet's sunlit side, where more gaseous jets bubbled through the comet's surface. Suddenly the sun blazed golden through his screens, blinding him for the instant before his eyes snapped shut. He eased back on the throttle and snapped the shielding visor of his helmet into place. 
 
 `` Mission Control to Solo 1. Report!'' 
 
 `` Sorry Mission Control. Holding back a little.'' 
 
 `` Problems?'' 
 
 `` Could n't maintain a visual. Making course corrections now. Rendezvous to Comet Ellie is still on.'' 
 
 `` Proceed Solo 1. Be careful, Toby.'' 
 
 `` Copy that MC.'' 
 
 The renewed approach called for a more risky trajectory. Harrison focused all his thoughts on the dark side of the comet, imagining a cool, welcoming surface. He plunged the craft into an approaching dust plume, shielding him from the sun but leaving him blind to any hidden dangers. The recklessness of the course set in familiar feelings of panic as the craft shook and rolled but he fought the urge to pull away. Not this time, he promised himself as clouds of stormy grey billowed past the window. Hold on, he thought. Remember the gravity. Remember the pull. 
 
 And then he was through. The comet's rocky surface loomed large before him and it was glorious in its perfection. He slammed the attitudinal controls, setting the landing sequence a little aggressively in his haste to join the surface. Outside he could see a chunk of hailstone shoot up past his window, and emerge into the broad sunlight where it condensed into a single clear teardrop. He turned away, his attention back on the surface. 
 
 * 
 
 The teardrop coursed its way down her cheek. Ellie Harrison did n't dare look Toby in the eye for fear of breaking the moment. Her 8-year old son held her in an embrace that was surprisingly strong. Standing across the room, Toby's father looked as stunned as she felt. She could read the elation in David's face, and a reflection of her own longing for this very moment. Closing her eyes to the torrent of feelings that overwhelmed her, she managed to hold perfectly still. Her son was hugging her for the very first time. That was enough.

Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B,"[ WP ] The Earth is flat , you , as the head of NASA , have to explain to the incoming President why its a secret .
","General Bolden made his way to the antechamber, as he had done twice before. He recalled with amusement how Presidents Bush and Obama simply laughed at him before carrying on with the briefing, just as his predecessors recalled tales of `` The Revelation'' dating all the way back to the Johnson administration. It began as a dare, something two drunken scientists made in a Houston bar back in the days of the Mercury program. If either of them made it to the office of the Administrator, they would assemble some official-looking presentation and bring it in for the President's in-brief. Something in private, very secret, plenty of pomp and circumstance for what would really just be an icebreaker at the beginning of a long and boring meeting. 
 
 It was largely forgotten by all who made it up, until Jim Fletcher remembered a funny story he had heard at a Christmas party a few years ago. He saw who Nixon's successor would be, figured Gerry Ford had a sense of humor, and gave it a shot. What he did n't expect was that President Ford would buy it hook, line, and sinker. To save NASA the embarrassment, he quickly had official reports drawn up with shaky physics to explain why millennia of accepted science was wrong, and why it had to be kept a secret from the community at large. 
 
 Over the years, it became a tradition, part of the President-Elect's initiation into the country's highest office. Most of them figured that with that much technobabble, it had to be true, though a few struggled with it. After Jimmy Carter was elected, there was some concern, as he had sailed around the world in his Navy days. The physicists cooked up a line about gravitational lensing near the edge of the earth causing ships to imperceptibly turn away, and Carter took it as truth. Reagan laughed it off, H.W. ignored it, and Clinton believed it all. Their next concern came in 2001, when Senator Glenn let an old colleague know that President Bush had been asking about it. After savoring the mortified look on Mr. Goldin's face, the Senator let him know that he was one of the young astronauts who came up with the joke in the first place. 
 
 Even with the years of tradition behind it, it was still a nervous time for the Administrator. To be found out was to risk dismissal or worse, risk losing funding for NASA. Still, there were certain things that just had to be done. Certain rituals to be observed, for old time's sake. 
 
 General Bolden nervously cleared his throat as he said those words his predecessors had said so many times before: `` Mr. President, could we please speak in private?''

Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B,"[ WP ] You hold the job title in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter where you say random words looking for spells
","I'm really not sure why I took this job. I have family members who are retired Aurors. They view me with a mix of shame and despair. I've got family members who are pardoned Death Eaters, and they feel the same way. 
 
 I may not be the black sheep of the family, thanks to the aforementioned Death Eaters, but I do n't get asked a lot of questions at family dinners. 
 
 Oh well, fuck them. I get paid decently enough to sit on some semi inhabited island around Iceland to come up with new spells. 
 
 Why am I near Iceland? Because my job is the equivalent of throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. Highly volatile spells come out of my research. The Ministry created this post about a decade after they finally put Voldemort down for good. As the son of decorated Aurors, I was able to get the job pretty easily. My resume boasted both the pedigree and the skill. 
 
 Also, as my former supervisor said, `` I'm one crazy son of a bitch.'' 
 
 He's my former supervisor because one day, working on a teleportation spell, he vanished. His whereabouts are unknown, but there are rumors that he's using his magic to great success in Vegas, hustling blackjack. 
 
 I always liked that guy. 
 
 Now, I'm the boss. I have a new recruit. Fresh faced kid out of Hogwarts, who takes everything way too seriously. I worry about his ability to hold up in this line of work. Between the remote location and the dangers of our work, he's ripe to crack up. 
 
 `` So, what are we working on today?'' the Kid asks. 
 
 `` The Ministry wants us to start coming up with countermeasures, just in case the Old Ones rise.'' 
 
 `` But, but, my Defend Against The Dark Arts Professor said that the Old Ones can never rise again.'' 
 
 `` You're not at Hogwarts anymore, the stars could be right at any moment, then we all could be shit out of luck.'' 
 
 I have to remind the kid of that a lot. He's still wearing his robes, looking like he's about to go to some damn Potions lecture. Meanwhile, I used a proven teleportation spell ( I do n't fuck around with those ) to `` borrow'' full SWAT Team gear from the Dallas Police Department. They have nice toys in Texas. 
 
 `` So, what's our first spell going to be?'' 
 
 `` Special banishment spell,'' I reply. `` One to cross over dimensional walls.'' 
 
 No wizard, even that Potter guy, could singlehandedly banish an Old One. But if enough talented wizards got involved, the spell might have a chance. Might. 
 
 The Kid did n't need to know that part. 
 
 `` There's a baseline spell I put together to get rid of a few Dementors,'' I continue. `` Did you watch the presentation?'' 
 
 `` Yes, I did. Although we never used that strange device at Hogwarts `` 
 
 I shake my head. Hogwarts should really at least mention what a DVD players is to its students. 
 
 `` Okay, we're going to basically take that spell and crank it up a few notches. Let's make sure you've got the basic spell down before we continue.'' 
 
 `` Alright,'' he replies 
 
 `` Remember: right arm fully extended, off to the side. Swing it in a controlled motion across your body.'' 
 
 `` I got you,'' he says, a little more confident than I like. Damn Gryffindors are always like that. 
 
 `` What's the activation phrase?'' 
 
 `` Piercus Four,'' he answers. 
 
 `` Good, let's see you do it.'' 
 
 The kid steps over to the other side of the room. As soon as he goes into the motion, I know it has gone to shit. He does n't extend how arm far enough from his body and he moves way too fast. Before I can yell for him to stop, the fateful words come from his mouth. 
 
 `` Piercus Four!'' 
 
 The space around him blurs. By keeping his arm close and going too fast he redirects the spell at himself. My worst fears are confirmed when that space stabilizes. 
 
 The Kid is gone. 
 
 Shit. 
 
 Now I have to go find him.

He reached over the floating counter top and grabbed another green bag from the shelf. After uncapping the top, the liquid slowly slid out and splashed into another shotglass in his hand. The counter bobbed down slowly as Bob dropped the bag on it. `` I signed up to go see the sights and meet new cultures! Not to get stuck in an office signing contracts and making ads!

 Bill had forgotten that he was still holding the glass and his angry arm waving sent tiny orbs of the green liquid onto uniform of the person next to him. Aweah'jebe did n't notice though.

Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B,"[ TT ] A retired soldier sets out on a journey ... and gets entangled in mob warfare between various magical factions .
","Akron returned to his room, another day gone and he was no closer to finding work. He was a good swordsman, but the army had just dismissed a legion of good swordsmen back to a kingdom who did not need a single one. He might have found work as a Night Patrolman had his unit been in one of the companies nearer home when the war was over. As it was, he and likely most of his brothers in arms were living on tabs and promises of payment. He was beginning to wonder how much farther he could make his'soldier's honor' stretch. 
 
 
 He had nearly gone to bed when there was a knock at his door. He opened it to find an empty walkway. He stepped out to look down into the tavern and saw no one rushing for the door. When he turned back to his room he saw a note just on the other side of his door. It read, `` Akron, Meet at King's Fountain. I have work. - Pitch.'' Akron folded the note. Pitch had never been a brave man in the company, but he was the most resourceful. What he lacked in holding the line he more than made up for in his scrounging after the line no longer needed to be held, most of which he kept for himself. 
 
 -- - 
 
 Akron waited at King's Fountain as the letter asked. A chill swept through the empty square and he wished he had brought his coat. The hairs on his neck pricked when he heard a set of footsteps approaching. `` Akron old boy,'' a voice called, `` I did n't think you'd come.'' He held his arms out wide. 
 
 
 Akron turned, `` You were right to think so,'' he replied, keeping his hands in his pockets. 
 
 
 `` C'mon sarge,'' Pitch goaded, `` Is that any way to greet an old man-at-arms.'' 
 
 
 `` As I recall, your arm stayed sheathed more often than not,'' Akron said back, a hint of bitterness coloring his words. If Pitch was disappointed he did not show it. `` You said you had work,'' he laid down his cards. They were not and had never been friends, but the promise of work bought Pitch a meeting. 
 
 
 `` Alright,'' Pitch said, slumping a little, `` I work with one of the Mage Schools.'' 
 
 
 Akron waved his hand, `` No,'' he said, `` No thank you, I'll have none of that.'' 
 
 
 Pitch raised his palms, `` Please, Sarge, just hear me out.'' Akron shook his head, but then nodded. `` They just need some muscle, Sarge. You do n't got to do anything, you do n't got to say anything. You just need to be in the room to make my guys look tougher than they are.'' 
 
 
 `` Tougher?'' Akron spat, remembering the power the wizards wielded during the war. Some nights he could still see the crawling embers on his men when the enemy Fire Schools unleashed their power on his lines. `` Why would they need to look any more dangerous than they are?'' 
 
 
 `` Sarge, it's just a power play. This school's not a big one, they just need to bring up their numbers a bit at the meeting,'' Pitch said, shrugging his shoulders. 
 
 
 `` What meeting?'' Akron asked, squinting at the scoundrel. 
 
 
 Pitch shook his head, `` I should n't even be telling you this,'' he said as his eyes widened. 
 
 
 `` Talk.'' 
 
 
 `` They want a seat at the Mage's Circle,'' he said, `` Something big is about to happen in the city, and they want a part of it when it all goes down. No one's taking them seriously because they do n't got the numbers.'' 
 
 
 `` So what?'' Akron asked, `` You add to them one guy who ca n't use magic?'' 
 
 
 `` Not just one, Sarge,'' Pitch said already starting to wince, `` I got some of the other guys from the company.'' 
 
 
 `` Gods on high, Pitch,'' Akron sighed, `` All of them?'' 
 
 
 `` No, Sarge, not all of them. Some of the boys did n't want no part of this. Still shaky from the Mage Fire. You remember do n't ya Sarge?'' 
 
 
 Akron nodded and clenched his jaw. 
 
 
 `` I'll pay you standard plus what I would have paid the other guys,'' Pitch said, `` It wo n't work without you, Sarge. You got ta get them back in line, whip them up, look impressive. The mages I work with will take care of the rest.'' 
 
 
 Akron began to shake his head, but his stomach grumbled loud. A hint of a smile crept across Pitch's mouth. `` How much does it pay?'' Akron asked. 
 
 
 Pitch tossed a bag of gold coins to his old superior. `` That's just what the other guys get,'' he said already grinning, `` You get that bag and four more like it.'' 
 
 
 Akron looked inside and saw more gold than he'd seen in a long time. `` Fine,'' he said. 
 
 
 Pitch clapped his hands, `` Good man, Sarge.'' 
 
 
 `` But I wo n't take more than the men,'' Akron said, `` divi it all up evenly.'' 
 
 
 `` Alright, Sarge, alright. If that's what you want,'' Pitch said as he wrung his hands. `` The Archmage is gon na love you.''

","`` Who here has been in an aDAM attack?'' I said, addressing the college audience. I was glad I was here, giving my account of the aDAM attacks. It was a good job; I sacrificed too damn much for this world, and it had given me little in return. Being a touring guest lecturer across the world was a dream come true. 
 
 Two kids raised their hands in the fact. The girl looked like she was about to fall asleep, but the guy poked her with a cane-yes, a someone still used a *cane* in 2112. The guy also raised his hand, his face grinning broadly. It really made me want to smack it right off. 
 
 `` Interesting. There's at least 300, no, 500 students in this lecture hall? Usually, I get a lot more. I'm sorry. I apologize for not doing my duty as a U.N. soldier. Civilian casualties have been rising over the recent aDAM Encounters. Let us have a moment of silence and pray for all the students who could not make it here today.'' 
 
 And then there was that moment of silence. After lowering my head for the smallest of tilts, I opened my eyes early to find those same two kids looking at me. The girl looked bored, and the guy looked like he was trying his hardest crack up silently. It looked like he was having a spasm. 
 
 `` You. Girl with the auburn hair and guy with the cane. Get up here,'' I demanded. The girl looked annoyed-did she have resting bitch face or something? -and elbowed the guy, who could n't hold it in anymore and burst out laughing. The rest of the auditorium was quiet as the duo made their way forwards. It made the cane's impacts with the floor that much louder. 
 
 `` You two are also U.N. soldiers, are n't you? Cains?'' 
 
 `` Eh? Yeah, how did you know?'' the girl said, looking surprised. 
 
 `` Arrogant brats,'' I growled. `` Stop lying. First of all, even if you were Cains, you're not a soldier yet. You two are still students.'' 
 
 `` Well, duh, we're students in a college auditorium...'' 
 
 `` Do n't give me that attitude,'' I snarled. I wanted to slap her face. In fact, the guy's too. He gave up standing and was rolling around on the floor. 
 
 I put an arm proudly on my black uniform. `` I am a U.N. soldier, part of the 82nd generation. I have fought in the previous 12th aDAM Encounter, when the aDAMs decimated Paris and terrorized everyone in France. I was pinned to the ground for hours when the level of the Gravity Field surpassed everybody's expectations. Do you know how hard it is to be helpless, unable to move? I only survived because I drank the rainwater that sipped into my mouth. I could n't do anything as the aDAMs stepped onto my fellow soldiers and brothers. And you, *you* have the gall to pretend to be U.N. soldiers?!? You have not been in my situation! Have you been bragging to your friends that you're one of the lucky few to be Cains, defenders of humanity? Do n't make me laugh. You're sad, pitiful, human beings.'' 
 
 This time, the girl also began cracking up. `` Ooooh boy,'' she giggled. `` This guy is really a looner.'' 
 
 Then the guy finally began to speak. `` Please dude, stop speaking. You're embarrassing us. A true Cain never talks about past aDAM Encounters they've been in. They're too traumatizing.'' 
 
 `` Too traumatizing for spoiled kids like *you*, I presume. And what about this?'' I said, clasping my uniform. `` Where are yours? Let me guess. They were somehow vaporized by the aDAMs, leaving you barely alive to tell the tale?'' 
 
 `` Wow, how did you guess?'' the guy said, raising his eyebrows. 
 
 `` I think mine's in the laundry,'' the girl said. She had a pinky in her ear, digging around for some earwax or something. Again, it made me want to tear their heads off. `` Who's dead body did you get yours from?'' 
 
 `` Enough. Have an arm wrestle contest with me,'' I growled, lying down on the ground. 
 
 `` Arm wrestle contest?'' they both said simultaneously. Then they both began laughing again. 
 
 `` It is below me to use violence,'' I said. `` But I need to teach either of you to learn your places in front of a true Cain.'' 
 
 `` Sure. Jenn, you got this,'' the guy said. The girl sighed, but also laid down. 
 
 I'll concede. I was not actually a Cain. The boy was correct; I looted the uniform off a corpse. But the experience was true. I was in Paris when the aDAMs hit and destroyed my life forever. My family was killed instantly: fiancee, parents, and everybody else at my wedding. Only my one-year old daughter was left alive, born out of wedlock. But despite our sins, my entire family, none of us deserved to die. It's a horrible feeling, having your child die in your arms, because the damned Cains took too damned long to slay the aDAMs. 
 
 So I undertook my revenge. Of course I could n't use violence directly and suicide bomb into their headquarters or something. But I could embarrass Cains, like those two naive fools who thought they could challenge me. My arm was n't real; lost in the Parisian aDAM Encounter, I had it replaced with a robotic arm. covered with real skin. A strong robotic arm, one that would not lose to even Cains. The charade has been going on for a while, and been going well. I was having my revenge. 
 
 `` So cocky you think you can beat me, little girl?'' I said, readying my arm. To my surprise, she took her pinky out of her ear and placed that sole finger on my palm. 
 
 `` Ready?'' she said, and at that moment, I knew I was fucked. A split second later, bolts and screws were flying around everywhere, electricity spewing from splayed wires as I stared in shock. 
 
 `` God, you're such a dumb dude if you did n't think the U.N. was watching you,'' the guy said, yawning. `` Please. H.Q. wanted to expose you directly with a public announcement, but we Cains convinced them that we wanted to have some fun. Mannnn it was hilarious seeing you'beat' Cains in arm-wrestling contests who pretended to try their hardest. Shame Jenn here was getting too pissed off.''

","The vast hull of the X'tac ship emerged a million miles from the surface of the earth. Hatu sat in his chrome throne in the control room, gazing at the blue planet slowly spinning beneath them. They'd sent scouts eons ago and now the time to reap the planet's bounty had come. He lifted his fingers in an almost absent gesture. Beside him, his second barked out the orders. All around him, subordinates scurried around, beginning the assault. Canisters of poison shot out from the cannons. The canisters had been made to explode upon entry into the atmosphere. The acid would vaporize, but then, when it rained, it would rain acid. All there was left to do now was wait and Hatu was patient. 
 
 Hatu was not _this_ patient. They'd been raining acid on the planet for weeks. Still the planet rotated upon its tilted axis and still the humans did not come and beg mercy. He'd been told kings would beg to give him water and algae. That he could plunder their lands to his fill. Why did the humans not cry for succor? 
 
 A subordinate bowed low before him. Hatu waved his hand and his second barked at the subordinate to proceed. 
 
 `` Sir,'' the subordinate said, shaking in fear but admirably keeping the tremor out of his voice, `` our attack is failing. We are running low on ammunition.'' 
 
 `` What!'' Hatu roared. There was just the briefest moment of satisfaction when everyone started at the power of his voice. `` How is this possible?'' 
 
 The subordinate looked down now, too cowed to meet Hatu's eyes. Hatu glowered at him. `` You will answer my question, scum.'' 
 
 `` Sir,'' the subordinate said, voice barely above a whisper, `` the earthlings. They-they appear to be…they appear to be drinking our poison.'' 
 
 `` In fact, many people have been collecting it in large urns,'' another voice piped up somewhere behind him. 
 
 Hatu could feel the eyes of his subordinates upon him, looking to him for guidance, but all he could think was, `` If the acid from the orange fruit could not burn the humans, if they could so boldly drink that, what use was any of their weapons?'' 

","To solve this problem, we need to understand the logical paradox presented by the alien overlord. The alien's statement ""How is this possible?"" suggests that the aliens are trying to prove that their army is not effective by pointing out that they ate the ammunition that was supposed to be used in the assault.

This paradoxical statement can be interpreted as a form of logical paradox, specifically a self-referential paradox. To break it down, let's consider the following:

","Janice turned to me, her big blue eyes still full of childish innocence. Damn - I'd forgotten that she was watching the Presidential Inauguration for a school project. `` Daddy,'' she began, `` what does the President mean? What's'gay'?'' 
 
 `` Well, honey...'' I began, but trailed off as I tried to think of a way to explain it to a five year old. `` Uh... Well, you know how Mommy and Daddy like to hold hands, and to cuddle, and kiss, and stuff?'' 
 
 `` Yeah! It's funny when Mommy pinches your butt when you're not looking, and makes you squeak!'' she giggled. Kids, man - I'd forgotten what it was like to be so amused by the word `` butt''. Had I ever been that small, that innocent? 
 
 I waited for her giggles to subside before I carried on. `` Well, sweetheart,'gay' means that he - the President - he likes to do that stuff with a boy, not a girl like Mommy.'' 
 
 I could see the confusion in her eyes as she struggled to process this new information. Damn you, McCain, for making me explain this to her! She's not old enough for this; she's not ready! *I'M* not ready! 
 Janice opened her mouth to speak. I knew what was coming; I'd opened the door to a lifetime of sexual deviancy. My sweet little girl was gone forever. 
 
 Suddenly I realized she'd something, and in my worry, I'd completely missed it. `` Sorry, sweetheart - what did you say?'' I asked, fearing her response. What fresh hell have I unlocked? 
 
 `` I said, I'm hungry. Can I have a cookie? Please, Daddy?'' 
 
 I was stunned, unable to respond at first. 
 `` Uhm. Sure,'' I answered. `` Get one for your brother, too.'' 
 
 Huh. I guess that maybe what two consenting adults do behind closed doors is n't that big of a deal after all. 
 Even when they *are* public figures.
","To provide an accurate and comprehensive answer, we need to consider the typical response of the country regarding the reaction of the newly elected President who is gay. Given the nature of the question and the context, a reasonable answer could be a summary of the common reactions of the United States to a gay President.
